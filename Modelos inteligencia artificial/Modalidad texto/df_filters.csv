Well what's the problem? Let me change it.,neutral

He's like a manager for a theatre.,neutral
He's like a house manager. Yeah. It's a good job.,neutral
He just...,neutral

You did?,neutral

You've been looking for a job for a long time; that was a long time ago. Right?,neutral
Yeah.,neutral
Hmm.,neutral
I don't know. He had a really good resume I guess and--,neutral
Yeah. Do you have a resume?,neutral
It's kind of helpful when getting a job.,neutral
I just- I mean I call people up and I tell them what I'm good at.,neutral
Well maybe we should sit down some time and you can just tell me all the stuff that you have done and I'll write it out.,neutral
Yeah.,neutral
"No. You can- or you can just bring it in person. But they need, generally, something to see, you know, what kind of what that you've done, what kind of--",neutral
"Yeah. But the piece of paper helps, too.",neutral
"No. But it has an outline, you know.",neutral
"I know. Okay. Well, um. Maybe--",neutral
Yeah.,neutral
"Okay, yeah. I would imagine.",neutral
"Well, sometimes you have to do things that you don't necessarily like to do to have a job. But the job affords you money, you won't have to be taking the bus right now.",neutral
maybe get a car.,neutral
"I just, you know, think you should try a little harder maybe.",neutral
I didn't say that.,neutral
"I am riding the bus, but by choice.",neutral
"To save the environment, carpool.",neutral
Yes. One less car at a time.,neutral
Mmhmm.,neutral
I'm not frustrated.,angry
Who do you think you are?,angry
I don't think I'm anyone.,neutral
You are so high and mighty. I just--,angry
I- I-I didn't-- okay.,neutral
Oh. I'm saving the environment. I'm riding this car because I- I want to.,angry
"The bus, I'm riding the bus because I want to.",angry
I can not-- you are not here by choice. Nobody would ride this bus by choice.,angry
Hi. Thanks for waiting.,neutral
Can I help you?,happy
Uh huh.,happy
Okay.,neutral
Okay.,neutral
Okay. Great. I'm really sorry that you had to do that. What's your last name? Let's start there.,neutral
Okay.,neutral
all right- okay. And you lost your bag? Is that- that the issue?,neutral
Flight seven fourteen.,angry
Uh-huh.,neutral
"Am I going to be getting, like, free tickets, free mileage. When can I expect my bag here?",angry
"Yeah. Yeah, I don't see- I don't see any--",neutral
"I don't see any record of it, and I-usually when I don't see a record of it, that means um-",neutral
"we've mistakenly lost your baggage. We're very sorry. On behalf of Jet Blue I would like to apologize for any inconvenience. I am allowed to issue you a fifty dollar gift card which you can use any future flights you want to take with us. I'm very sorry, once again...",neutral
"for such an inconvenience and your bag, but",neutral
Is this a joke?,angry
Yeah.,neutral
"No, no.",neutral
"Are there candid cameras? Is this that movie? There's that show, right? Airplane, airline.",angry
"No, no. This is real.",neutral
"No. I'm just giving you money, the bag is gone. If it's not here, I'm really sorry there is nothing I can do because...",neutral
this is the only track record that we have and if it's not listed here then it's probably not anywhere.,neutral
"You're kidding me, this is a joke.",angry
Do you have any idea-- fifty dollars? That's supposed to replace everything that I have? Do you understand how much I have packed in there? Not only does it have sentimental value; it can't be replaced like that. It was incredibly expensive.,angry
Yes.,neutral
I know.,neutral
We flew in from Paris. I've been shopping for three weeks.,angry
I don't care what you're freaking sign says. Somebody- Somebody needs to replace everything I've got there and give me money for my inconvenience.,angry
Okay. Calm-,neutral
"Actually, we are not necessarily liable to give you- to even give you this fifty dollars so... it's actually- it's actually really",neutral
Do you understand who my husband is?,angry
"If you're- if you're- if you're looking for a lawsuit, baby, you've found it.",angry
"We are actually not even allowed-- you know, like we don't have to give you this fifty dollars. We don't have to do that.",neutral
Oh-Oh. It's a gift. You're-You're helping me out here?,angry
It's a gift.,neutral
"You know, the airlines can not be held responsible for every bag of luggage that comes through here.",neutral
You are cruising for a bruising. You are in so much trouble.,angry
With the amount of--,neutral
Who's in charge? Who is the president of Jet Blue?,angry
"Um, actually, I don't know. I don't know. Oh really?",neutral
Because I probably know him.,angry
Yeah.,angry
Well then maybe you can just call him and he can give you more money. But right now all I can do--,neutral
"I don't want money, I want my clothes.",angry
"Right now all I can do is just give you this fifty dollars, I'm really sorry.",neutral
What's your name?,angry
Oh. My name is Sean. Hi.,neutral
"Badge number? Uh, no. You can just take my employee number I guess.",surprise
Okay. I'll do that.,angry
Why? Have I done something wrong? Have I given you bad service? I feel like I have done the best I could.,surprise
I don't think you have done everything you could do because I don't have my bag here yet.,angry
"If you want, you can write a letter. I can give you the address. Yes. An angry--",neutral
A letter? I'll make a personal phone call.,angry
"Or you can make a phone call. But I think a letter might be a little more-- in my impression, letters have more...",neutral
"I'm sorry, Joy.",sad
Is there anything I can get you? Do you want me to take care of anything for you or...?,neutral
...pick up anything?,neutral
No.,sad
You know you are welcome to stay at my house if you want to just check out for a couple days and hang out.,sad
That's sweet.,neutral
Thank you.,neutral
I went to see her headstone a week or two ago.,sad
"I used to go to cemeteries a lot before she died. I just, you know, I felt like they were urban oasis, you know, there is always this green in the city.",sad
Hmm.,neutral
So I was like wandering around before. It takes forever to find her headstone; I always lose it. You know.,sad
So I was looking at this other one and there was like a piece of candy there and I thought that I would take the candy and put it on her headstone. And-,sad
"this woman came up and, you know, it was hers. It was her person that was there.",neutral
Oh. She was there?,neutral
"Yeah. And she was like, that's pathetic, I hope you enjoy it.",sad
"And I, you know, I mean, I said I was sorry and I brought it back to her kind of and I like put it on the ground and she was like, no, it's fine. She was like, I would rather have her back, honestly.",sad
Mmhmm.,neutral
"I don't know. It just, like, I felt so bad because I shouldn't have done it. I don't know. Whatever.",sad
Yeah.,sad
I don't know.,sad
How long were you there for?,neutral
At the cemetery?,sad
Mmhmm.,neutral
couple hours.,sad
"I brought- I brought Chuck with me. He went to Redlands, yeah, for the day. We ran through the sprinklers.",neutral
Oh really?,neutral
You ran through the sprinklers in the cemetery?,neutral
Is it a big cemetery?,neutral
Yeah. It's huge. Redlands is an old city so they have lots and lots of stones.,neutral
"Oh, so they're like really old too, really old ones?",neutral
Yeah.,neutral
"It's weird. Whenever I go back to town, I think of her. I mean, it's like ... I mean we grew up together and she died when we were twenty one. And yeah. She had cancer, she had two brain tumors.",sad
"My best friend Heather. She's got a- we have a- we built this like little-- There's a park, Prospect Park. And there is like a garden section of it that we set up for her.",sad
She used to have these poetry parties on Memorial Day.,sad
Mmhmm.,neutral
Umm. Yeah.,sad
"And the last time before she died, I remember she couldn't really stand, umm...",sad
"But I mean she could, but it was- so it was kind of sitting at her feet holding her up and she had these poems she had memorized. And I remember looking up, she had curly red hair and there was this palm tree right behind her and it was like a crown growing right out of her head. It was cool.",sad
Mmhmm.,neutral
"Some, I guess. She memorized this one, John Dunn, it's called, Death Be Not Proud. and-",sad
So she wrote a lot of poetry?,neutral
"There's another one, I can't remember.",neutral
"I remember, too, when we were-- she died at U.C.L.A. She had brain surgery and there was not much hope to begin with, but I gave blood for her surgery, her mom and I before, so we dropped her off in the waiting room and then we were giving blood and came back. And she, in her wheelchair, like can hardly do anything, reciting her poetry for these people like in the waiting room. All she needs is a God damn audience. You know?",sad
Is this a Masters or a P.h.D.? Or can you...? Nice,neutral
"That's good. Don't you have to like teach a class, too, when you do that?",neutral
"Of course, right. That's where the real money is, being a student.",neutral
That's how you get the big bucks. Are you messing with the chair? Don't ruin it.,happy
He saw it.,neutral
How could he see it? I was the first one up; he was still in bed.,surprise
He was out here when it broke.,neutral
Four o clock this morning. I heard a crack and I woke up and looked out. He was standing right over there when it cracked.,neutral
I don't know.,neutral
"He's dreaming of him again, walking around.",neutral
I guess he is.,neutral
You know Larry is not coming back and I know it. Why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him?,neutral
We've got to say it to him.,neutral
"Sit down, Mom. I want to talk to you.",neutral
You know.,neutral
"Well I got an idea, but what's your story?",neutral
I'm going to ask her to marry me.,neutral
You know it's not just my business.,neutral
"So all right then, I'll just go ahead with it?",neutral
"You know sometimes you infuriate me. you know that? Isn't it your business if I tell father and he throws a fit about it? God, you have such a talent for ignoring things.",angry
I wanted to get this settled first.,neutral
"Well if she does, then that's it. That's the end of it. From her letters, though, I think she's pretty much forgotten him.",neutral
And then we'll thrash it out with father. Okay Mom? Don't avoid me.,neutral
Just give it some more thought.,neutral
What the hell is this?,angry
"I'll get out. I'll get married and I'll move somewhere else, maybe New York.",neutral
You have a business here. What the hell is this?,angry
Oh. Must you be inspired?,angry
"On this, I would.",neutral
Then help me stay here.,neutral
"All right. But you don't want to think like that because what the hell are we working for, Chris? It's all for you. This whole shooting match is for you.",angry
Just don't think like that.,angry
Well maybe...maybe he just wanted to see her.,neutral
He's not going to marry her.,angry
How do you know he's even thinking about it?,neutral
It's got that about it.,angry
"What is going on here, Joe?",angry
She is not his girl. She knows she's not.,angry
"Then why is she still single? New York is full of men, why is she still single? Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish, but she waited.",angry
How do you know why she waited?,neutral
"Because she knows what I know, that's why. She's faithful as a rock. In my darkest moments, I think of her waiting and I know that I'm right.",angry
"Nobody in this house dares take away her faith, Joe. You know strangers might, but not his father, not his brother.",angry
"I want you to-- I want you to act like he is coming back, both of you. Don't think I haven't noticed you since Chris invited her here.",angry
I won't stand for any nonsense.,angry
"Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself. Oh laugh, laugh all you like but why does this happen the very night he comes back. She goes to sleep in his room and his memorial breaks in pieces. Look at it, Joe, look.",angry
"Just believe with me, Joe. Only last week a man came back in Detroit missing longer than Larry. Believe with me. You, above all, have got to believe. Just believe.",angry
"What have I got to hide? What the hell is the matter with you, Kate?",angry
You're the only one who still loves his parents.,neutral
"I know. It kind of went out of style, didn't it?",neutral
It's not so bad; it's a good thing.,neutral
"[BREATHING] You know, it's lovely here. The air is sweet.",neutral
You're not sorry you came.,neutral
"I'm not sorry, no. But I'm...I can't stay.",neutral
"For one thing, your mother much as told me to go.",neutral
Well.,neutral
"And then, you. You've been kind of...",neutral
What?,neutral
Sort of embarrassed ever since I got here.,neutral
Well I was kind of planning of sneaking up on you over the course of a week or so. They just take it for granted that we're all set.,neutral
I knew they would.,neutral
"Well sure, from your mother's point of view. Why else would I come?",neutral
"I, umm. I guess, I guess that's kind of why I came.",neutral
[BREATHING],happy
"I love you. Annie, I love you.",happy
[LAUGHTER],happy
"I don't really have any imagination, that's all I know how to say.",happy
[LAUGHTER],happy
"Am I embarrassing you? Are you - See, I didn't want to do it here with this yard, on this porch. I wanted it to be somewhere new, some place fresh for both of us.",happy
No. No,happy
"Chris, I've been ready a long, long, time.",neutral
I almost got married two years ago.,neutral
You started to write me.,neutral
You felt something that far back?,surprise
Every day since.,happy
Why didn't you let me know?,happy
Give me a...,happy
Give me a kiss.,happy
beating around the bush.,happy
"I will never forgive you. All I'd done was sit around wondering if I was crazy waiting so long, wondering if you were thinking about me.",happy
"Oh Annie, we are going to live now. I am going to make you so happy.",happy
Not like that you're not.,happy
I kissed you.,happy
"Like Larry's brother. Do it like you, Chris.",neutral
"Hey, let's drive some place. Huh? Let's get out of here.",sad
No it's nothing like that. It's-,sad
Yeah. I suppose I have been. But it's going from me.,sad
I don't even know how to start.,sad
"It's just all mixed up with so many other things, you know? You know overseas I was in command of a company?",sad
"Yeah, sure.",neutral
Well I lost them.,sad
How many?,neutral
Pretty much all.,sad
"Aw, geez.",sad
You can't just toss off a thing like that because they weren't just men. You know?,sad
"Like for instance, there was this one time it had been raining for several days and this kid he just came up to me and he gave me his last pair of dry socks. He just put them in my pocket. That's a little thing, you know, but that's what kind of guys I had.",sad
"They didn't die, they killed themselves for each other. I mean that, exactly. Just a little more selfish and they would all be here today.",sad
Mmhmm.,neutral
"To bring that on to the earth again, you know, is like some kind of monument and I thought I would just make a difference to them.",sad
"But then I came home and it was incredible, you know? The whole thing was just kind of this random bus accident. You know, I went back to the rat race again, I went to work.",sad
And I didn't want any of it. I guess that included you.,sad
I just want you to know Annie.,neutral
What would I do with a fortune?,happy
Fine.,neutral
What flashlight?,surprise
"The flashlight, the silver one. There's only one, isn't there?",neutral
That's not your flashlight.,neutral
Whose is it?,neutral
"Oh...well. Yeah, of course.",neutral
You keep saying my flashlight like it's just yours.,angry
No.,neutral
How's that supposed to make me feel?,angry
"Of course, our flashlight. What's yours is mine. Me flashlight es su flashlight.",neutral
Do they always run during a full moon? I don't remember. Was it full last year?,neutral
Yeah.,neutral
"Huh. Are you cold? Do you want my jacket? No? you know, we should have brought the blanket? Our blanket.",neutral
"Aw. Do you know, I should have brought a six pack, too. A six pack, that would be just the ticket right about now. Huh?",neutral
[LAUGHTER],happy
I'm cold.,sad
Right.,neutral
"Wait, that's my point, too.",neutral
Not particularly.,neutral
Why not?,neutral
"Honey, this is like a natural phenomenon. I mean... People in Kansas would have to get plane reservations and get hotel rooms to see this. It's just forty minutes away for us; it's too good to pass up.",neutral
Yeah. But this..this moment on the beach is like the highlight of their little lives. All that flopping around is laying eggs or what to do - spawning or mating or whatever.,neutral
This is a big night for these little guys. It's like life's last orgy.,neutral
"There's like mystery here, there's magic. It's like a little bit of the unexplainable. I just can't see how you're not interested.",neutral
For real?,surprise
"God, I don't get it. you know the first time we came here, you said it was the best night of your life?",neutral
"And last year, I remember distinctly you said, you were so excited to get here that you don't remember you stubbed your toe until we were in the car.",neutral
Ahh...we weren't in a good spot.,neutral
"We just weren't in a good spot. I'm telling you, this is a much better spot. I have instincts for these things.",neutral
"God, this is great. Think about this. I know you are not interested, but just think about this.",happy
That's the wind.,neutral
So what do you think?,happy
About what?,neutral
"About all of that, about all I was talking about.",happy
That's the wind.,neutral
About what?,neutral
About what I was saying.,neutral
"Carla, can I ask you something? Now, don't take this the wrong way, but are you on your period?",neutral
"Don't ask me that. I hate it when you ask me that, you always ask me that. It's insulting.",angry
"For God- Grow up, Augie. The fish are not going to arrive.",angry
Because they never do. Have they...Have they ever?,angry
Twice is every time we have tried; that's ever.,angry
"I feel like I'm always just standing here waiting. I feel like this night is going to be the night, but it never is.",sad
"For God's sake, this is not about fish.",angry
"Okay. So you were fine during that phone call from Marge and then dinner was okay. And doing the dishes was fine and then I was going to take a shower and you're watching the news and you said the grunions are running tonight, do you want to go? And I said, sure great, let's go.",neutral
"Okay. So I am putting out the pets, getting the car out of the garage.",neutral
Do you remember the first year we came here? It was like four years after we got married.,neutral
"You whispered the sweetest, most intimate things to me right into my ear so I could feel them as much as hear them. And I remember thinking, this is it. You know, finally, I am as happy as I'm supposed to be.",happy
"It's when we were driving past that Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said, let's get some champagne. I said no, time's a wasting or something like that.",neutral
I'd rather not remember some things. I'd rather not hope for some things.,sad
Sure. All right. Okay.,neutral
"Listen, do you want to dance?",neutral
No.,neutral
Do you want me to go get some champagne?,neutral
Do you want to take off your shoes?,happy
Do you want to get married again?,happy
No.,neutral
Yes it is.,neutral
"I know you are Augie, I know.",sad
"I know you meant this to be special, I know that you wanted it to be right, but I just can't help thinking that, I can't help wishing that I was somewhere else.",sad
"Maybe if you were with someone else, too.",sad
I didn't say that.,sad
I just- I know I don't make you happy.,sad
"Don't be ridiculous. Anything that- anything I am doing, I'd rather be doing it with you.",surprise
Yeah?,surprise
Yeah. Don't you know that?,surprise
"You're the one who probably wishes he was with somebody else. Somebody who doesn't take things so seriously, who could enjoy herself.",sad
"You know, actually now that you mention it, no I don't.",neutral
"So maybe we are in the wrong spot, but we are with the right person.",neutral
"We have a great view of the moon from here, though, huh?",neutral
"Hmm. I noticed that, it's pretty. Big old white moon.",happy
[BREATHING],neutral
And look what I got here.,happy
"Augie, you bought refreshments.",happy
I guess we don't need glasses.,happy
[BREATHING],happy
Do you want to go home? Are you cold?,neutral
I'm beginning to think this might be the right spot after all.,happy
"Augie, I'm sorry.",sad
"Shh. If we're very quiet, the fish might come.",neutral
Or not.,neutral
Or not.,happy
Good God.,fear
Is it them?,fear
I wonder.,fear
Freda is the only one who knows we are here. She wouldn't ring up.,fear
It must be them then.,fear
It had to happen sooner or later. What are we going to do?,fear
[BREATHING],fear
No. Wrong number. [LAUGHTER],happy
[LAUGHTER] That sent shivers up my spine.,happy
What shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us.[LAUGHTER],happy
With perfect poise.,happy
"It's strange; things that ought to matter dreadfully, they just don't matter at all when one's happy. Do they?",happy
Yes. Meaning just that.,happy
"Well what does it all mean? That's what I ask myself in my quest for ultimate truth. Dear God, what does it all mean?",happy
Don't laugh at me. I'm being serious.,happy
Who knows?,happy
[LAUGHTER],happy
Oh Come and kiss me darling before your body rots and worms pop out of your eye sockets.,happy
"Oh Elliott, worms don't pop.",happy
"Oh See, I don't care what you do, see. You can paint yourself green and run naked through the Place Vendome and run off with all of the men of the world. I shan't say a word, just as long as you love me best.",happy
"Aw. Thank you, darling. The same applies to you too, except that if you so much as look at another woman I'll kill you.",happy
It was a terrible thing. I hated it.,disgust
"That was a rouser, wasn't it?",happy
"The manager came in, he found us rolling about the floor, biting and scratching like panthers. [LAUGHTER] How utterly, utterly ridiculous.",happy
[LAUGHTER] I'll never forget his face. [LAUGHTER],happy
[LAUGHTER] We were very much younger then.,happy
[LAUGHTER] And very much sillier.,happy
And very much sillier.,happy
However I believe the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.,neutral
Oh. You knew there was nothing in that.,happy
I knew nothing of the sort. You took presents from him.,neutral
"Presents? It was only a trivial, little brooch.",happy
You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.,neutral
I did not. You worked that whole thing up in your jealous imagination.,neutral
"Well, what of it?",neutral
What about me?,angry
"I'll have a little, I think.",neutral
"No particular reason. Anyhow, they are very small ones.",neutral
Don't be stupid.,angry
"Really, Amanda.",angry
What?,angry
"you going out somewhere, dear?",neutral
No. I am just making myself fascinating for you.,angry
Oh. It's a woman's duty to allure the man.,angry
"Well as a matter of fact, yes, that's perfectly true.",neutral
No it isn't.,angry
Yes it is.,neutral
You shut up.,angry
"Oh really. It's a pity you didn't have any brandy, it would have made you a little less disagreeable.",angry
"Snap, snap, snap. You know you are like a little adder.",angry
Nonsense. They have a bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap. They snap.,angry
They sting. I don't care. Do you understand? I don't care if they bark and they roll about like hoops.,angry
Did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?,angry
"Yes I did, quite a lot.",angry
"And I suppose you let him kiss you a good deal more than, too. Yes. I suppose you guys had a riotous time, huh? All out, no restraint at all. Well, you never really had much anyhow.",angry
Mind your own business.,angry
"You're quite insufferable, I expect it's because you are drunk.",angry
I think I am not in the least bit drunk.,angry
You've always had a weak head.,angry
I think I mentioned once before that I've had three minute liquor glasses the whole evening long. A child of two cannot get drunk on that.,angry
"On the contrary, a child of two can get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy.",angry
"That's very interesting Amanda. How about a child of four? Or a child of six? Or a child of nine? We can get a good little conversation going on about this, you know, intemperate tots.",angry
Oh shut up.,angry
Shut up.,angry
"Not very funny, darling. Why don't you have some more brandy.",angry
"Look, you better turn that off. I don't want to wake up the people upstairs.",angry
Why?,neutral
There are no people upstairs; it's a photographer's studio.,neutral
Well then you'll wake up the people downstairs.,angry
They are away in Tunis.,neutral
This is no time of year for Tunis.,neutral
I will do no such thing.,angry
Fine if you insist on being boorish and idiotic.,angry
"Will you turn that off, it's driving me mad.",angry
"You are far too temperamental, try to control yourself.",angry
Turn it off.,angry
"I won't. Let go, let go of me. Listen, listen? I'm sick and tired of listening to you, you sadistic bully.",angry
"Amanda, listen, listen.",angry
Oh. That's very amusing indeed.,angry
"Oh shut up. Let go. I hate you, I hate you. Do you hear? You are a conceited and overbearing and utterly impossible.",angry
"You are a vile, ill-tempered, loose living, wicked little beast and I never want to see you again as long as I live.",angry
This is the end. Do you hear me? Finally and forever.,angry
You're not going like this.,angry
Oh. Yes I am.,angry
You're not.,angry
"Yes I am. Stop it. Stop it. Let go of me. Oh. You're a cruel fiend. I loathe and I hate you. Marry you again? Never, never, never. I hope you die in torment, you brute beast cad.",angry

Don't raise your voice with me.,angry
Don't talk to me like I'm a child.,angry
Do you know how long I've been working here? How long have you lived in California?,angry
"Maybe you never been to the D.M.V. before, maybe you should get back in line. You know what? sit in line again and if you get my number ask for different one.",angry
I am not...I'm not getting to back that line.,angry
Uh huh. I didn't come here get in yelling match either.,neutral
They don't pay me enough to deal people like you.,neutral
Why?,angry
"Why, because I'm sick of talking to you.",angry
"'Cause you're obviously not talking to me, you're just yelling at me, berating me and telling me I can't fill out forms right.",angry

You're going with the same ones?,sad
Do promise me you're going to take a lot of pictures.,sad

It's not the same though.,sad
I just wish there was something I could do.,sad

I can't finish the sentence with you without you jumping in...,neutral
...and you're always right.,neutral
You have an excuse for everything.,neutral

Oh. That is incredible. Is it--,neutral
They do it's--believe me it's huge.,happy
It's pretty wild.,happy

Oh you mean it's not really sport that what you're saying?,surprise
It's totally a sport. What are you talking about?,surprise
Yeah we have like away games and stuff.,neutral

What do you mean a mistake?,angry
"What, can you prove it? What proof do you have? Can you prove it?",angry
"To you it is, to me it is. But to your father? You can talk yourself 'til you're blue in the face but there's was no grave and there is no body. So where are you?",angry
The trouble is those god damn news papers. Every month some boy comes back missing longer then Larry so--,angry
Why?,angry
I'm going to ask her to marry me.,neutral
"Well, what do you want me to do? You're old enough known your own business.",angry
"See. Then it's not just my business. Sometimes you infuriate me, you know that? You know it's just your business too if I tell father and he throws a fit about it, huh?",angry
I'm sorry. I ignore what I've got to ignore. That girl is Larry's girl.,angry
She is not Larry's girl.,angry
"From father's point of view he is not dead and you have no right to take his girl. I'm just saying that you can go on from there if you know where to go but I'm saying I don't know where to go. See, I don't know.",angry
You're a considerate fellow. There's nothing wrong in that.,neutral
To hell with that.,angry
Did you ask Annie yet?,neutral
"No, I wanted to get this all sorted out first.",sad
I don't see why it has to be Annie.,angry
"That's a good answer but it doesn't answer anything. You haven't seen her since you went away to war, it's been five years.",angry
"He thinks he's coming back, Chris. You marry that girl you're pronouncing him dead.",sad
"Do you know what that'll do to you, to your father, do you know? I don't.",angry
What the hell is this?,surprise
Are you crazy?,angry
You have a business here. I said what the hell is this?,angry
Business? The business doesn't inspire me.,angry
"Oh, must you be inspired.",angry
"Yes, yes I like it for one hour a day. I don't care if I have to grub for money all day long when I come home I want it nice, I want a family, I want to kids and Annie is in the center of that.",angry
"Yes, on this I would.",neutral
"Well, you don't want to think like that.",angry
Then help me stay here mom.,sad
"All right but you don't think like that because what the hell is this all for. This is all for you, what are we working for Chris? The whole shooting match is for you.",angry
Then help me stay.,sad
"Well, you don't think like that.",angry
I am thinking like that.,angry
"I don't understand you, do I?",angry
"No, you don't. I'm a pretty tough guy.",sad
"Well, I can see that.",angry
Why did he invite her here?,angry
"Well, maybe he wanted see her.",neutral
It's been three and a half years. Why all of a sudden?,angry
"Well uh, He grew up next door to the girl, why wouldn't he want to see her?",neutral
"What is going on here, Joe?",angry
The girl is not Larry's. If the girl is Larry's girl she's not his she know she's not.,angry
And how do you know why she's waited.,neutral
"I want you to---act like he is coming back. Don't think I haven't noticed you, both of you since Chris invited her here. I won't stand for any nonsense.",angry
"Oh, laugh at me, laugh all you like but why does this happen to very night she comes back? She goes to sleep in his room and his memorial breaks in pieces. Look at it, Joe look.",angry
"Believe with me Joe, you got to believe. Only last week a boy came back missing longer then Larry you read it yourself.",angry
You above all have got to believe. Just don't stop believing.,angry
What does that mean? Me above all? What does that mean?,angry
Look at you. You're shaking.,angry
"What the hell do you want from me, Kate?",angry
The only one I know still love his parents.,neutral
"Yeah, that kind of went out of style didn't it?",happy
Oh it's not bad thing it's good thing.,neutral
You're not sorry you came?,happy
"Not sorry, no. I can't stay here.",sad
Why not?,sad
For one thing your mother as much as told me to go.,neutral
[BREATHING] And then you've been kind of...,sad
What?,neutral
You've been kind of embarrassed ever since I got here.,sad
You did?,neutral
From her point of view why else would I come?,neutral
Yeah--,neutral
"Ann, I love you. I love you.",happy
I almost got married two years ago.,neutral
Why didn't you?,neutral
I'll never forgive you for waiting so long. All I did was sit around and wonder if I was crazy for thinking about you.,happy
I kissed you.,happy
"Chris, what's the matter?",sad
Do you want to go somewhere? Let's go.,sad
"No, what is it? Is your mother?",sad
"No, no, it's nothing like that.",sad
I don't know it's--it's complicated. But it's going from me now.,sad
You got to tell me.,sad
I don't know.,sad
It's kind of all mixed up with all these other things.,sad
Wouldn't work like this.,sad
you know over seas I was in command of the company?,sad
"Yeah, sure.",sad
Well I lost them.,sad
How many?,sad
Pretty much all.,sad
[BREATHING]. Geez.,sad
"Takes awhile to toss something like that off. I mean they weren't just men, you know.",sad
"For instance, there was this one time when this kid--it had been raining for like several days and he gave me his last pair of dry socks.",sad
He just put it in my pocket that's the kind of guys I had.,sad
"They didn't die they killed themselves for each other and I mean that exactly, you know a little more selfish and they'll all be here today...",sad
"And I had this idea as I was watching them go down like everything was being destroyed, you know. But I felt like this one new thing was being made, you know it's kind of like this. This monument...",sad
"You know, that they were bringing something on to this earth, a kind of sacrifice you know.",sad
"I thought I would change everything you know, and I got back here and it was- it was like nothing had changed at all...",sad
You know. I went to work with dad and I started that whole rat race again...,sad
And no one had changed it was just like sort of random bus accident to them.,sad
Driving my new car and I felt guilty you know opening my bank book seeing a new refrigerator.,sad
'Cause you can take those things out of a war. But you have to realize that those things came out of the love that a man can have for another man...,sad
And if you can't see that then it's just loot and there's blood all over it.,sad
I felt ashamed and I didn't want any part of it. I guess I included you too.,sad
Do you still feel that way?,sad
I want you to know Annie.,sad
I'm going to make a fortune for you.,happy
What would I do with a fortune?,happy
What flashlight?,surprise
Flashlight the silver one. There's only one isn't there?,neutral
"Oh, well, yeah of course.",neutral
"You keep saying ""my flashlight"" like somehow it's just yours. How's that supposed to make me feel?",angry
"Of course, our flashlight. What's your is mine, mi flashlight es su flashlight.",neutral
"Gosh, I should have brought it. I can't believe I forgot that.",neutral
No.,neutral
I'm fine.,neutral
I wonder if they can hear me talk,happy
Right.,neutral
That's my point too.,neutral
Then let's go.,angry
People in Kansas would have to get plane tickets and make hotel reservations to see this. It's only forty minutes away; it's just too good to pass up.,angry
"Pass what up? These little fish swim out of the ocean, they flop around on the sand then they swim back and then they die.",angry
"Yeah, they do.",neutral
Yes.,angry
"Last year, you'll also remember we got--our shoes got wet, I got sand in my panties, you got a sore throat, we got into a big fight and we did not see the grunions.",angry
We just weren't in a good spot though.,neutral
We didn't see them the year before either.,angry
"Come on, trust me I got instincts for these things, okay? So just--just think about it all right? Okay, I know you're not interested, think about it...",neutral
That's the wind.,neutral
Can I ask you a question? Are you on your period?,neutral
"Why do you ask me that? God damn it, I told you not to ask me that I hate it when you ask me that. It's insulting.",angry
"I just, we just have different ideas of what this evening is supposed to look like.",angry
"Because they never do. Do they, have they ever?",angry
We missed them twice.,neutral
Twice is every year we've tried that's ever.,angry
No we won't. It's pointless it's like a waiting up to see Santa Claus.,angry
"I feel like my whole life is going to be spent here on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasped expectantly, waiting for fish to show up and the fish never show.",angry
"you were fine during the phone call from Marge, dinner was okay, doing the dishes was fine.",neutral
"Let's see, uh, I took a shower and, um, you were watching the news and you said the ""the Grunions are running tonight,"" and I said ""okay great, let's go.""",neutral
So I'm putting the animals out we're getting the car to the garage and--,neutral

"Wait a minute, I've got it.",neutral
"It was when we were driving passed that knickerbocker liquor locker and you would said, no you said ""let's get some champagne"" and I said ""no time to wasting"" or something like that. That's what it is, right?",neutral
I'd rather not remember some things. I'd rather not hope for some things.,sad
"Oh right sure, of course.",neutral
No.,sad
You want me to go get some champagne?,neutral
No.,sad
Do you want to take off our shoes?,neutral
What? Huh?,neutral
You want to get married again?,neutral
"A new carpet, a poodle, a suicide pact, ice cream, a back rub, what? What? What the hell do you want?",angry
I want something to turn out the way that it's supposed to.,angry
You think nothing turns out how it's supposed to. You think I had some grand idea going that four years down the line. We would come to this beach and argue over fish? No.,angry
"No, no I'm just like you, I thought it was going to be all rosy cheeks and the bills would pay themselves and fish will always come and--",sad
No. You know what you get? You know what you get? You get this.,sad
This what? What is this? This isn't even anything.,angry
"Yeah, it is.",neutral
"Oh, sure this is standing on the beach, this is waiting, fighting.",angry
Right.,neutral
This isn't anything like I thought anything would be.,sad
I know me neither.,sad
This is just this. I mean it includes a lot and everything but it's--do you understand what I'm saying?,sad
I'm doing the best I can.,sad
"I know that Augie, I really do.",sad
"I just can't help wishing that I was somebody, somewhere else.",sad
Maybe if you were with somebody else too?,sad
I didn't say that.,sad
"No, I know but--I know I don't make you happy.",sad
Are you kidding me? For heaven sake Augie anything I'm doing I'd rather be doing it with you.,surprise
Yeah?,sad
"Yes, don't be ridiculous. Don't you know that?",surprise
"You are the one who probably wishes he was with somebody else, someone who didn't take everything so seriously, someone who would enjoy yourself.",sad
Look what we got here.,happy
It's not champagne.,neutral
I guess we don't need glasses.,happy
"Are you cold, huh? Do you want to go home?",neutral
I'm beginning to think you might be right. I think this might be the spot after all.,happy
"Augie, I'm sorry.",sad
Shh...,happy

Or not.,neutral
Or not.,neutral
Good God.,fear

"Oh, dear god what is that all mean, dear god?",happy
[LAUGHTER] Don't laugh at me I'm being serious.,happy
"You mustn't be so serious, darling, it just what they want.",happy
Flippancy brings out the acid in their darn sweetness and light.,happy
"Mmhmm If I must laugh at everything, I must laugh at us too.",happy
"How long will it last, this ludicrous, overbearing love of ours?",happy
We are figures of fun all right,happy
Ahh...who knows.,happy
Shall we always want to bicker and fight?,happy
If one of us dies...,happy
I think you're talking nonsense.,happy
before your body rots and worms pop out of your eye sockets.,happy
"See, you know I don't care what you do. You could paint yourself green and run naked to the Place Vendome.",happy
Do you remember that row we did have in Venice?,happy
Which particular one?,happy
Cannes...mmhmm...,happy
The manager came in he found us rolling about the floor. [LAUGHTER],happy
I will never forget the look on his face.,happy
Scratching and biting like panthers. [LAUGHTER] Oh...,happy

Did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?,angry
"Yes, I did quite a lot.",angry
I suppose you let him just kiss you or good deal more than too.,angry
"Oh, mind you own business.",angry
"I suppose you two had a riotous time, huh? No restrain at all, very enjoyable, he never had much any how.",angry
"You're quite insufferable, I expect it's because you're drunk.",angry
I am not in the least bit drunk.,angry
You always had a weak head.,angry
I think I told you once before that I had three minute liquor glasses the whole evening long. A Child of two cannot get drunk on that.,angry
"On the contrary, a child two could get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy.",angry

"That's all, that's all, that's all you're going to do is just give me fifty dollars and say go have fun on your vacation without any of your stuff?",angry
"I think, um, maybe you can file a claim if you want and turn it in to our main office--",neutral

"You paid for the flight and then your bags were checked at--it's a service that the airline provides for us. So so, really, it's really the risk was taken and, I'm sorry, but there's really nothing else we can do. So do you want--do you want the reimbursement?",neutral
"Well, there are-there are some shops here in- in the airport--",neutral
"No, um, like I said you can file a claim and, uh, maybe get reimbursed for more-- you",neutral
probably even talk to--,neutral
"Right, that--that gets taken care of-- That gets taken care of. We get we do, you know, we investigate those and just make sure that um- they're not doing their own thing with them so--uh",neutral

"Okay. Well that that could be something that you put on on the claim--on on the complaint form if you want. And provide us with your information while you're here and then, maybe, if it turns up, then we'll send it right over.",neutral
It sounds like it's such a little like oh well no big deal whatever. It's a big deal to me.,angry
"All right, Miss, I-I know. I realize this. But Like I said, there are several people that are in your same situation, so, um, it's not--it's not totally uncommon and I'm actually gonna have to ask you to move so I can help the next person.",neutral
"Yes, all right. There you go, now you can file a claim over to the left--And they'll help you out.",neutral
"Hey, a what's up?",neutral
"Um, Johnny died yesterday.",sad
"Wow, that's horrible.",neutral
I'm sorry to hear about that.,neutral

He did a lot. But--,sad

"But It's okay because now, you know, you'll just go on with your life and--",neutral
I'm gonna forget him.,sad
"No, you'll never forget him.",neutral
I won't be able to hear his voice or his--,sad
I know. but you're not I mean you're not going to forget him. The pain will go away eventually and--or it will subside--,neutral
You start to lose like that image after a while.,sad
"That will be, It'll be--it'll be better that way. I mean Time will tell. Time heals, you know, and it's good. It's okay. I mean, it wasn't anybody's fault or anything like that so .",neutral
"It's hard to lose someone that way, but he's he's better--he's better off now.",neutral
Thanks.,sad
"So, how's it going?",neutral
So...,neutral
That'll be awesome.,happy
"I mean because you went to the campus before, right?",happy
"Hi, my name is Shiloh, welcome to--Airline Six. Hi, how may I help you?",neutral
"All right, sir.",neutral
I completely understand. Automated systems are very difficult sometimes.,neutral
Okay.,neutral
"Um, how may I help you. You're trying to book a specific flight?",neutral
"Oh, yeah, absolutely. You know, and especially because you've been waiting so long and I know that, um, you've been having a difficult time.",neutral
"I want to definitely give you our special package today, which um is usually only for valued customers who have a record of having previous,",neutral
"um lots of purchases, but we're gonna go ahead and give that to you anyway. uh, Just to make sure that you're happy with your service here.",neutral
You- You can do that--You can do that now? I don't have to get like transferred through or anything like that.,neutral
Is that all right?,neutral
"I can do that right now for you. No, absolutely. I can take care of you all the way through to the end.",neutral
All I'm going to need is your credit card number but just give me one moment. So-,neutral
[BREATHING] that's good.,neutral
"um, you're scheduling a flight as well--And you would like to, um, we have a highly discounted hotel rate that goes along with that so that everything is all in one deal. You're taken care of by the time that you get there.",neutral
"All right. I want to make sure it's like a nice hotel--I mean-mean I'm gonna be paying a lot of money for this so I don't wanna-I don't wanna, you know, I don't wanna to be a waste of time.",neutral
Absolutely. we we,neutral
"Yes, I completely understand. Actually, our-our airline only uses five star hotel and above. Except we charge at a three star hotel rate because, as a corporation, we are able to get a deal from the hotels themselves.",neutral
"So, you will absolutely be in a high rated great hotel and we can make sure that it's in a area of town that you like as well.",neutral
Okay. So--,neutral

Okay. Great. What time of the day would you like?,neutral
"Uh, well, yeah, I think we were just--you know, whenever best available, I guess. You know--",neutral
All right. Great. Well we have a very open flight that leaves at nine a.m. and fortunately uh the time change actually goes um backwards from that.,neutral
"So, it's a five hour flight, but you'll arrive only at eleven a clock in the morning. So that day, you can have plenty of time to get to your hotel--Rest up and then still have a nice afternoon your first afternoon in Maui.",neutral
"And, like, there's there's shuttles or something that I can get to the hotel.",neutral
Absolutely. That actually goes in on the same package with our hotel. You just give me your address. We'll come and pick up a time that allows you to get to your flight with plenty of time to spare.,neutral
And a there will also be a shuttle waiting for you to take you to the appropriate hotel.,neutral

Absolutely. Thank you so much for calling and we hope that you will come to us again.,neutral
Okay.,neutral
Thank you.,neutral
Did you talk to him?,sad
He cried hard?,sad
What was he doing out here at that hour?,sad
Why shouldn't he dream of him and walk the nights waiting for him? Do we contradict him? Do we say straight out that we don't have any hope anymore? That we haven't had hope for years now?,angry
"For God sakes, it's been three years. Nobody comes back after three years. It's insane.",angry
"I've got an idea, but what's the story?",sad
I'm gonna ask her to marry me.,neutral
"Well, that's only your business, Chris.",neutral
What do you want me to do? You're old enough to know your own mind.,angry
"Well, then it isn't just my business--",angry
I'm just saying that--,neutral
She's not Larry's girl.,angry
You're a considerate fellow. There's nothing wrong with that.,neutral
To hell with that.,angry
[BREATHING] Have you asked Annie yet?,neutral
"Well, how do you know she'll marry you? Maybe she feels the same way your father does.",neutral
"Well, if she does, then that's the end of it. But from her letters, I think she's forgotten him. I'll find out. And then we'll thrash it out with Dad, right? Mom, don't avoid me.",sad
"Trouble is, you don't see enough women.",sad
Because it is.,neutral
What the hell is this?,surprise
Are you crazy?,angry
I've been a good son too long. A good sucker. I'm through with it.,angry
What about the business? What the hell is this?,angry
The business? The business doesn't inspire me.,angry
Must you be inspired?,angry
"Yes. I like it an hour a day. If I'm gonna grub for my money all day long, at least in the evening I want it beautiful.",angry
"Yes, on this I would.",neutral
"Well, you don't want to think like that.",angry
I am thinkin' that way.,neutral
"No, you don't. I'm a pretty tough guy.",neutral
I can see that.,sad
"Well, maybe he just wanted to see her again.",neutral
What do you mean? He lived next door to the girl all his life. Why wouldn't he want to see her again?,neutral
How do you know he's even thinking of it?,neutral
It's got that all about it.,angry
"Well, so what?",neutral
"Now, listen Kate.",neutral
You can't read her mind.,neutral
How do you know why she's waited?,neutral
"Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself. I mean, laugh--laugh at me, but...",angry
But why did that happen the very night she came here? She sleeps in his room and his memorial breaks to pieces. Just look. Look at it.,angry
What does that mean? Me above all?,angry
Look at you. Look at you shaking.,angry
What have I got to hide? What the hell is the matter with you Kate?,angry
You're not sorry you came?,neutral
"from her point of view, why else would I come?",sad
I almost got married two years ago.,happy
You started to write me and--,happy
Every day since.,happy
I will never forgive you. Why did you wait all these years? All I did was sit and wonder if I was crazy for thinking of you.,happy
No. Nothing like that.,sad
"Then, what's wrong? I mean, even in your letters there was some--something ashamed.",sad
"Yeah, I suppose I have been. But it's going from me.",sad
You've gotta tell me.,sad
I don't know how to start.,sad
It wouldn't work this way.,sad
"It's all mixed up with so many other things. You remember overseas, I was in command of a company?",sad
"Yeah, sure.",sad
"Well, I lost them.",sad
How many?,sad
Just about all.,sad
"Oh, gee.",sad
It takes some time for a guy to toss that off. 'Cause they weren't just men.,sad
"For instance, one time, it had been raining several days and this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks. I put them in pocket. It's only a little thing, but that's the kind of guys I had.",sad
"They didn't die, they killed themselves for each other. I mean that exactly. A little more selfish and they'd have been here today.",sad
"I got this idea watching them go down. Everything was being destroyed, see, but it seemed that there was one new thing being made. A sort of responsibility. Man for man.",sad
"You know what I mean? To show that, to bring that onto the Earth again, like some kind of monument and everyone would feel it standing behind him and it would make a difference to him.",sad
Then I came back and it was incredible. There was no meaning in it here. The whole thing to them seemed like sort of a bus accident. I went to work with Dad and that rat race again.,sad
"And I felt what you said, ashamed somehow 'cause nobody was changed at all. It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys. I felt wrong to be alive to open the new bank book, drive the new car, see the new refrigerator.",sad
"I mean, you can take those things out of a war, but when you drive that car, you've gotta know that it came out of the love a man can have for a man. You've gotta be a little better because of it.",sad
Because otherwise all you have is really loot and there's blood on it. And I didn't want to take any of it. And I guess that included you.,sad
You still feel that way?,sad
What'll I do with a fortune?,happy
What flashlight?,neutral
"Oh, well sure.",neutral
"Right, of course. Our flashlight. Mine and yours. I mean, me flashlight is su flashlight naturally.",neutral
"I wonder, do they always run during a full moon? I can't remember if it was full last year. Do you remember?",neutral
Yeah.,neutral
"You cold? Do you want my jacket? Oh, we should've brought the blanket. Our blanket.",neutral
Do you want my jacket?,neutral
Right.,neutral
That's my point too.,neutral
No. No. That's not my point. The point is there's no point in coming down if we just leave. Don't you want to see it?,neutral
"I don't get it. The first time we came here, you said it was the best night of your life.",neutral
We weren't in a good spot.,neutral
We didn't see them the first time either.,neutral
"Well, so what do you think?",neutral
About what?,neutral
What I was saying.,neutral
About what?,neutral
What I was saying.,neutral
It certainly is not. It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact.,neutral
"Well, I'm not the only one. Look at all these people.",neutral
"Carla, can I ask you something? Don't take this wrong, but are you having your period?",neutral
"God damn it, Augie, don't ask me that. I hate it when you ask me that. You always ask me that. It's insulting.",angry
We just have different ideas of what this evening is supposed to look like.,angry
"There's nothing to it. We come here, the grunion arrive, they do their little fish business, we go ooh, ah, look at the fish. They go home. We go home.",neutral
We've missed them twice. That's not ever.,neutral
"Well, we'll see them this year.",neutral
"I mean, I feel like my whole life is gonna be spent standing on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasped expectantly waiting for the fish to show up. And the fish won't show up.",angry
It's just fish. Nothing to get traumatized about.,neutral
"You said, ""Hey the grunion are running tonight."" I said, ""Great, let's go. I feel lucky.""",neutral
"Okay, so I'm putting on my jacket, putting out the animals, getting the car out of the garage--",neutral
"Do you remember the first time we came to see it? It was about four years ago, right after we got married.",sad
"I thought I was pregnant, you had a bottle of champagne, but no glasses. You asked me to dance, so we kicked off our shoes and you popped the cork.",sad
"And while we were dancing, you said the softest, most intimate things to me right into my ear so that I could feel them as much as hear them.",sad
"And I remember thinking, this is it. You know, at last--at last I am as happy as I am supposed to be.",sad
Wait a minute. I've got it.,neutral
"Just dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne out of the bottle.",sad
"It was in the car, right? Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said, ""let's get some champagne,"" and I said, ""time's a wasting"" or something like that, right?",neutral
"Yeah, of course, I see it now. You want this to be like that other time, right? That's it, right?",neutral
I'd rather not remember some things. I would rather not hope for some things.,sad
"Okay, yeah, sure, I see it now. Listen, you wanna dance?",neutral
No.,sad
You want me to go get some champagne?,neutral
No.,sad
Take off our shoes?,neutral
No.,sad
"Well, welcome to the human race. Do you think this is what I had in mind when I proposed? That four years down the road, we'd be at the beach yelling at each other over fish?",angry
"No, Carla, I'm just like you. I thought it was gonna be all peaches and roses and sand in our toes and wind in our hair and the fish will always come and the bills will pay themselves and we'll have three fat rosy kids and ha, ha, baby, the joke's on us",sad
"Yes, it is.",neutral
Right.,neutral
Well. This isn't anything like I thought anything would be like.,sad
"I know, me neither.",sad
I'm doing the best I can.,sad
"I know that, Augie. Really, I do.",sad
"I know that you meant this to be special and nice and the sand and the moon and all, but I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else.",sad
Maybe if you were with somebody else too.,sad
I didn't say that.,sad
"No, I know. But still. I know I don't make you happy.",sad
Yeah?,surprise
You're the one who probably wishes you were with someone else. Someone who--you'd rather enjoy yourself and didn't take everything so hard.,sad
"I don't know. It seemed like a pretty good spot to me. I mean, look at the view you have of the moon from here.",happy
"Well, look what we have here.",happy
"Augie, you brought refreshments.",happy
It's not champagne.,happy
"Well, then we don't need glasses.",happy
No. I think you might be right. Maybe this is the spot after all.,happy
"Augie, I'm sorry.",sad
Shh. If we're very quiet the fish might come.,happy
Or not.,happy
Or not.,happy
Do you think it's them?,fear
I wonder.,neutral
"Well, nobody know we're here except Freda and she wouldn't ring up.",fear
What're we gonna do?,fear
I don't care then.,neutral
Hello? Hello? What? Wrong number.,neutral
Behave exquisitely.,happy
With the most perfect poise?,neutral
"Oh, of course. I shall probably do a court curtsy.",happy
Things that ought to matter dreadfully don't matter at all when one's happy. Do they?,neutral
What's so horrible is that one can't stay happy.,happy
"Oh, darling, don't say that.",neutral
It's true. The whole business is a very poor joke.,happy
"Meaning that sacred and beautiful thing, love?",neutral
"Yes, meaning just that.",happy
"You mustn't be serious, my dear one. That's just what they want.",neutral
Who's they?,neutral
All those futile moralists that try to make life unbearable. Laugh at them. Be flippant. Laugh at everything. All their sacred shibboleths.,neutral
Flippancy brings out the acid in their damn sweetness and light.,neutral
"If I laugh at everything, then I must laugh at us too.",neutral
"Certainly, you must. We're figures of fun, alright.",neutral
"Well how long will it last us, this ludicrous overbearing love of ours.",neutral
Who knows.,neutral
"Well, shall we always want to bicker and fight?",neutral
"No, that desire will fade. Along with our passion.",neutral
"Oh, dear, shall we like that?",neutral
Depends on how well we've played.,neutral
"Well, what happens if one of us dies? I mean, does the one that's left still laugh?",neutral
"Darling, I believe you're talking nonsense.",happy
So is everyone else in the long run.,neutral
"Elliott, worms don't pop.",happy
"I don't care what you do. See, you could paint yourself green and dance naked in the Place Vendome and rush off madly with all the men in the world and I shan't say a word. As long as you love me best.",neutral
"Oh, thank you, dear. The same applies to you except that if I catch so much as looking at another woman, I'll kill you.",happy
You remember that awful scene we had in Venice?,neutral
Which particular one?,happy
The one when you bought that little painted wooden snake in the Piazza and put it on my bed.,neutral
Charles. That was his name. Charles. He did wriggle so beautifully.,happy
"Yes, I know you did. You threw it out of the window into the Grand Canal. I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.",happy
How long did that row last?,neutral
It went in intermittently for days.,happy
The worst one was in Cannes when your curling iron burnt a hole in my new dressing gown.,neutral
It burned my comb too and all the towels in the bathroom.,happy
That was the first time you ever hit me.,neutral
I didn't hit you very hard.,neutral
"The manager came in and found us rolling around on the floor, biting and scratching like panthers.",happy
We were very much younger then.,neutral
"As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.",neutral
"As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.",neutral
I knew nothing of the sort. You took presents from him.,neutral
What of it?,angry
"Well, what about me?",angry
"Well, if you hadn't been so suspicious and nosey, you never would have known a thing about it.",neutral
"Me, too. Bored stiff. You want some brandy?",neutral
No particular reason. Anyhow they were very small ones.,neutral
Just seems so silly to go on and on and on with such a thing.,neutral
"Well, it's become a habit with you.",neutral
"You needn't be so grand, just because you don't happen to want any yourself at the moment.",angry
Don't be so stupid.,angry
What?,angry
"Oh, be quiet.",angry
"Adders don't snap, they sting.",angry
You're quite insufferable,angry
I'm not in the least drunk.,angry
Shut up.,angry
"We could get a good debate going about this, don't you think? Intemperate tots.",angry
Why?,angry
"Turn it on again, please.",angry
I'll do no such thing.,angry
"Very well, if you insist on being boorish and idiotic.",angry
Turn it off. It's driving me mad.,angry
You are far too temperamental. Try to control yourself.,angry
Turn it off.,angry
Stop it. Go away. I hate you.,angry
"Amanda, listen. listen",angry
"Listen? Listen, indeed. I am sick and tired of listening to you, damn sadistic bully.",angry
"I hate you. Stop it. Stop it. I hate you, do you hear? You're conceited and overbearing and utterly impossible.",angry
"You're a vile, tempered, loose living, wicked little beast and I hope to never see you again as long as I live.",angry
This is the end. Finally and forever. Do you hear me? The end.,angry
You're not going like this.,angry
"Oh Yes, I am.",angry
You're not.,angry
I am. Let go of me. You're a cruel fiend and I hate and loathe you.,angry
Shut up. Shut up.,angry
I wouldn't-- I wouldn't marry--,angry
I wouldn't marry you if you came in crawling on your knees,angry
Thank God I realized what you are-- I'd never marry you again ever in my life. You're a cruel fiend and I hate you. You're a beast. You're a beast--I hate you. Stop it. Stop it.,angry
You're a evil vampire and I hope to God I never see you again as long as I live.,angry

"Um, that you would need to go home and get another form of ID and come back.",neutral
"What? I- You telling me I waited in that huge line to go and sit down and get my number called, like after",angry
three hours and,angry
Shouldn't they have like told us about that? I mean why - why would they make me go and wait three hours if I have got to go and do it again?,angry
"It's standard? I mean I don't work at the D.M.V. how am I supposed to know that, like, I stand in line, I get my",angry
"I filled out the application right, didn't I?",angry
"I'm sorry, sir.",neutral

You- shouldn't you have like a sign or something maybe like up on the counter when you get the applica- maybe on the application,angry
"What web- I didn't go to a website - why would I need to - it's the D.M.V.. You come to the D.M.V., you wait in line for three hours, and then you go home.",angry
I don't want you to go.,sad
"I know, I know. I don't want to go either baby. I love you know. And I'm going to miss you a lot.",sad
"I'm going to miss you too; I don't know what I'm going to do here without you. It's going to be so lonely, and so hard.",sad
I don't want to be a single mom.,sad
"You won't be. I'll be back; I'll be back before you know it. All right, and",sad
but,sad
and,sad
It's dangerous; I mean how can you make sure that you'll,sad
I hope so.,sad
I hope so.,sad
It's going to be really rough.,sad
"You gotta take care of our baby for me, alright?",sad
I'll send you lots of pictures.,sad
"I hope so, because I'm not going to be able to survive without all that. I don't know what I'm going to do.",sad
I've never been - I've never been away from you for two weeks let alone a year.,sad
"Well, just promise me that you going to be safe.",sad
"I mean can't they put you in like, you know kitchen work or something where you won't get",sad
there's people that thought it was the right thing to do so now we have to- we have to do what we have to do for our country,sad
"and it'll work out you know, go there and do that. Yeah, I'll be back",neutral
"Will you write me letters, paper ones?",sad
"Our baby needs a dad; you can't leave. Okay, you can't disappear.",sad
"Our baby has a dad, alright. Daddy is going to be back soon.",sad
"I want you to, you know, take lots of video; pictures and I can see you when I get back or while I'm there. I'm going to miss you.",sad

"I know, so",happy
I got to freak her out.,happy
"Yea, that way she was guaranteed that she could not say no.",happy
"Oh yes, they - they you know they love her and so I mean...",happy
"Oh, it will, obviously you know. But I know it's something - I don't know, you never really think about it happening, like before hand.",happy
"Sure. Oh, yes.",happy
Hah.,happy
So how you feeling?,neutral
"You've been doing a lot of work for it, right?",neutral
"Right, so the fact you doing the best that you can is -",neutral
"you know you shouldn't give yourself a hard time for that, it's the best you can.",neutral
"Well, but you care about what you do, right?",neutral
"I understand that it's so frustrating but I know that you're here because you really want it you know and, and uh",neutral
"Well, I mean you're still here you've tried for this long so I think that says something all in itself.",neutral
You are persistence. I mean that's important. that's,neutral
"Well, you're talented so keep that in mind, you know, you shouldn't give yourself too hard of a time.",neutral
I'm sorry.,sad
"I don't know, it's just not, I don't know - I don't know what to do really, you know, I'm just thinking",sad
"That's- I mean. There are more factors then just whether you're good or not, you know what I mean like",neutral
"and the fact that you know there is always different types of things and what kind of people they want in the office and whether it's male or female or you know what I mean, like things are out of your control.",neutral
So you should take that in consideration rather than giving yourself such a hard time.,neutral
this doesn't happen to a normal person.,angry
"You know and the fact you still here and still cooking, like it's good that you're thinking about it, that you're reconsidering.",neutral
"But like, just because you're considering why it's been so difficult doesn't mean you should just stop.",neutral
"Maybe you should take a little break from it, but I don't think you should stop.",neutral
Right. Thanks for talking to me.,sad
Hi. Um-,neutral
"Hi, can I help you?",neutral
It seems that uh- my-my bag didn't make it out on the carousel.,neutral

"Yes, yes, it's gone around like you know twenty times. It's been about a half hour.",neutral
"Okay. Well, um- the f.",neutral
"Actually I'm looking here at the information, the flight that you were on we had some trouble with some of the baggage, it looks like a few peoples' bags didn't make it through. Um, so-",neutral
Okay. So what-what do I have to get you know,neutral
"Well, you can fill out this paperwork um- and if for some reason it shows up, we can bring it to you, but-",neutral
"For some reason, so you think it won't show up?",surprise
"Well, sometimes it's just late baggage or misplaced baggage and it comes out but it seems to be here and just I'm reading off of this that",neutral
Uh- it didn't make it into the second plane so it looks like there - they don't actually know what happened to it.,neutral
"Um, well, sometimes there is just difficulties with loading on to the plane. Uh- There can be a theft or uh- some sort of you know mishap with a cart or something.",neutral
"I- I- I understand, but um.",neutral
Okay,neutral
Right.,neutral
"I understand that. Um- So I'm going to put down here that you looking for your baggage, but we actually can't, uh this bag is likely not going to show up so what we're going to do-",neutral
"Sometimes it gets stolen, sometimes it gets misplaced on another plane and",neutral
"they - they, it gets shipped to somewhere else and then it's stuck somewhere and then we have no way of tracking that.",neutral
So we'll- what we'll do,neutral
"But we have the tags on. I mean like it wouldn't you know, if it got stuck somewhere it's like well this is nobodies bag I mean maybe you know look on the tag and",angry
Right. Like I said sometimes a theft and things happen like that but we are willing to reim-reimburse you.,neutral
"Um, so.",neutral
"Theft? Don't you know like all these people that are work - you keep like an eye on them, how can they get away with-",angry
"We have very tight security but we -uh- there are times when we just can't uh make sure there aren't absolutely no human error, you know",neutral
I'm sorry there is no guarantee on baggage.,neutral
you don't realize the stuff that I've got in that - I really need to get the suitcase okay,angry
"I understand, so-",neutral
"all right, We've already checked back here for your baggage",neutral
and we will continue to look for it and because your paper-,neutral
"Well, it's- it's just sort of help with the fact uh that you lost some of your possessions and we rather do that than-",neutral
The airline can't afford to give you everything that is in that suitcase. and so-,neutral
The a- what? Talking about a core they can't afford it? I mean-,angry
Well because lots of people get their baggage lost and we don't want to have false claims or anything like that so we have,neutral
"we can give you fifty dollar to sort of make up for it, to compensate, and we can definitely let you know if it shows up but likely, more than likely-",neutral
I mean you're not helping me here. What do I have to do here? Do I need to sue the airline company is that what I should do,angry

"Yes. Well, at least you have a lot of good memories.",sad
She was [garbage],sad
"She really cared about you, you know.",sad
"Yes, I mean she cared about all of us. She was great",sad

"I just -- I just don't get it, like there is just nothing you can do about it you know, it's like just out of your control and it",sad
"just makes it that much harder to deal 'cause as much as you want to, you know, make her better, see her not in any pain, it's like, just I don't know, just has a mind of its own.",sad
"It's going to be okay, I promise.",sad
"Well, you know I appreciate you coming over and talking to me, I mean it definitely helps",sad

"pretend like your on a rotary phone, goes straight through to a person.",neutral
I know they don't tell you that kind of thing.,neutral
"Sorry. Okay. Um-, yes",neutral

Thank you very much bye.,happy
I don't know. When it cracked he ran into the house and cried in the kitchen.,sad
No. I figured it was best to leave him alone.,sad
I could hear him right through the floor in my room.,sad
We've got to say it to him.,angry
"For God sakes it's been three years, nobody comes back after three years, that's insane.",angry
You know why I brought Annie here don't you?,neutral
You know.,neutral
I got an idea but what's the story?,neutral
I'm going to ask her to marry me.,neutral
"Well, you want to make sure that your father isn't-",neutral
See it isn't just my business-,angry
From father's point of you he isn't dead and you have no right to take his girl.,neutral
"I don't know why but every time I reach out for something that I really want, I have to pull back 'cause someone else will suffer. My whole bloody life, time after time after time.",angry
You're a considerate fellow. There's nothing wrong with that.,neutral
To hell with that.,angry
I wanted to get this settled first.,neutral
How do you know she'll marry you? Maybe she feels the same way your father does.,neutral
"Well, if she does then that's the end of it. From her letters I think she's forgotten him.",neutral
"I don't know, I'll find out. Then we'll trash it out with dad, right? Mom, don't avoid me.",sad
"Trouble is you don't see enough women, you never did.",angry
I just don't see why it has to be Annie.,angry
"If I can't do that here well, then I'll have to get out.",sad
What the hell is this?,angry
"I'll get out. I'll get married and go live some place else, maybe New York.",sad
"What the hell is this, are you crazy?",angry
"I've been a good son too long a good sucker, I'm through with it.",angry
What about the business? What is this?,angry
The business? The business doesn't inspire me.,angry
Must you be inspired?,angry
"Yes, I like it and hour a day. If I'm going to grub for money all day long, at least in the evening I want it beautiful.",angry
"Tell me, you'd leave the business?",angry
"Yes, on this I would.",sad
"Well, you don't want to think like that.",angry
"Yea, I can see that.",sad
Why did he invite her here?,angry
She's been in New York three and half years why all of a sudden-,angry
"Well, maybe he just wanted to see her again.",neutral
Nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see.,angry
He's not going to marry her.,angry
How do you know he's even thinking of it?,neutral
"Well, so what?",neutral
What's going on here Joe?,angry
-She's not his girl Joe; she knows she's not.,angry
You can't read her mind.,neutral
"I want you to act like he's coming back, both of you. Don't you think I haven't noticed since he invited her, I won't stand for any nonsense",angry
I need you to believe with me; I can't stand all alone.,sad
"What does that mean, me above all?",angry
Look at you -- look at you shaking.,angry
"I know, it went out of style, didn't it?",happy
It's all right. It's a good thing.,happy
"You know, it's lovely here, the air is sweet.",happy
"No, not sorry. But, um. But I'm not gonna stay.",happy
What?,surprise
"I knew they would, your mother anyway.",happy
"Well, from her point of view, why else would I come?",neutral
I guess this is why I came.,happy
Why didn't you?,surprise
"Well, you started to write me",happy
Every day since.,happy
Let's drive someplace. I want to be alone with you.,sad
No. Nothing like that.,sad
"Well, what's wrong? I mean, even in your letters there was some--something ashamed.",sad
"Yeah, I suppose I have been. But it's going from me.",sad
It wouldn't work this way.,sad
"Well, I lost them.",sad
Just about all.,sad
It takes some time for a guy to toss that off. 'Cause they weren't just men.,sad
"For instance, this one time, it had been raining several days and this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks. I put them in pocket. It's only a little thing, but those are the kind of guys I had.",sad
"They didn't die, they killed themselves for each other. I mean that exactly. I mean, a little more selfish and they'd have been here today.",sad
"I got this idea watching 'em go down. Everything was being destroyed, see, but it seemed that one new thing was made. A sort of responsibility. Man for man. You know what I mean?",sad
"To show that, to bring that onto the Earth again, like some kind of monument and everyone can feel it standing behind him and it would make a difference to him.",sad
"Then I came back and it was incredible. There was no meaning in it here. I mean, the whole thing to them seemed like it's sort of a bus accident. I went to work with Dad and that rat race again.",sad
"And I felt what you said, ashamed somehow 'cause nobody had changed at all. It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys. I felt wrong to be alive to open the new bank book, drive the new car, see the new refrigerator.",sad
"I mean, you can take those things out of a war, but when you drive that car, you've gotta realize that it came out of the love a man can have for a man. You've gotta be a little better because of it.",sad
Otherwise all you have is really loot and there's blood on it. And I didn't want to take any of that. And I guess that included you.,sad
Do you still feel that way?,sad
I want you now Annie.,neutral
"'Cause you mustn't feel that way. Because you have a right to everything you have, Chris. Everything, you understand that? Me too.",sad
"I mean, and your money, there's- there's nothing wrong with your money. I mean, your father put hundreds of planes in the air. A man should be paid for that.",sad
What'll I do with a fortune?,happy
Fine.,neutral
What flashlight?,neutral
Yea.,neutral
I'm cold.,neutral
Not particularly.,neutral
Why not?,surprise
I'm just not.,sad
For real?,surprise
Yes.,neutral
"Last year you'll also remember our shoes got wet, I got sand in my panties, you got a sore throat, we got into a big fight over nothing, and we didn't see the Grunions.",angry
That's the wind.,neutral
About what?,neutral
So what do you think?,neutral
What I was saying.,neutral
Certainly it's not. Slightly exaggerated scientific fact.,neutral
Goddamn it Augie don't ask me that. I hate it when you ask me that. You always ask me that. It's insulting.,angry
We just have different ideas of what this evening is supposed to look like.,angry
"Well, we'll see them this year.",neutral
I mean I feel like my whole life is going to be spent standing on the beach waiting for the fish to show up with my eyes open and my hands clasped expectantly and the fish won't show up.,angry
"I did want to see them, I always do. I mean I keep thinking that this is going to be the time and it never is.",angry
"You were fine during the phone call from Marge, dinner was okay, doing the dishes was no problem, let's see, I took a shower, you watched the news, you said",neutral
"""the Grunion are running tonight,"" I said ""great, let's go, I feel lucky,""",neutral
"okay so I'm getting on my jacket and putting out the animals, getting the car out of the garage-",neutral
Do you remember the first time we came to see it? It was about four years ago right after we got married.,sad
"We thought I was pregnant and we opened a bottle of champagne but no glasses, you asked me to dance, we kicked off our shoes and you popped the cork.",sad
And when we were dancing you said the softest most intimate things to me right into my ears so I could feel them as much as hear them,sad
"and I remember thinking that this is it you know. At last, at last I am as happy as I am supposed to be",sad
"Just dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne out of the bottle.",sad
I'd rather not remember some things. I would rather not hope for some things.,sad
"Yea. Okay, sure, no. I see. Listen, you want to dance?",neutral
No.,sad
You want to go get some champagne?,neutral
No.,sad
Take off our shoes?,neutral
Get married again?,neutral
"Well welcome to the human race, all right. Do you think this is what I had in mind when I proposed? You think I had this great fantasy going that four years down the road we'd come to the beach and yell at each other over fish?",angry
"Well, but this isn't anything like I thought anything would be like.",sad
"No, I know. Me neither.",sad
"I know that you meant this to be special and nice, and there's the sand and the moon and everything but I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else.",sad
Maybe if you were with somebody else too.,sad
"No, I know. But still, I know I don't make you happy.",sad
Don't be ridiculous. I mean don't you know that?,happy
"You're the one who probably wishes he was with someone else, someone who knew how to enjoy herself and didn't take everything so hard.",sad
"Now that you mention it. No, I don't.",happy
I don't know it seemed like a pretty good spot to me. Look at the moon - view the moon view I got from here.,happy
What have we got here?,happy
"Well, I guess we don't need glasses.",happy
"Augie, I'm sorry.",sad
"Shh, if we're very quiet the fish might come.",happy
Or not.,happy
Or not.,happy
Hmm.,neutral
Good God.,fear
Must be them then.,fear
"We're all right darling, aren't we whatever happens?",fear
Now and always sweet.,happy
What do we do if they suddenly walk in on us?,fear
Behave exquisitely.,happy
With the most perfect poise.,happy
"Yes, I should probably to a court curtsey.",happy
"Things that ought to matter dreadfully don't matter at all when one's is happy, do they?",happy
Oh darling don't say that.,sad
Meaning that sacred and beautiful thing love?,happy
What does it all mean that's what I ask- that's what I ask myself in my ceaseless quest for ultimate truth? Good God what does it all mean?,happy
"No, that desire will fade along with our passion.",sad
"Oh dear, should we like that?",sad
"Well, what happens if one of us dies, does the one that's left still laugh?",fear
You remember that awful scene we had in Venice?,happy
Which particular one?,happy
"Oh Charles, that was his name Charles. It did wiggle so beautifully.",happy
I know you did. You threw it out of the window into the Grand Canal; I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.,happy
It went on intermittently for days.,happy
It burned my comb too and all the towels in the bathroom.,happy
"That was a rouser, wasn't it?",happy
The manager came in and found us rolling around on the floor biting and scratching like panthers.,happy
I'll never forget his face.,happy
"Oh it was ridiculous, completely ridiculous.",happy
And very much sillier.,happy
"As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.",neutral
I knew nothing of the sort. You took presents from him.,angry
No it wasn't. It was very pretty I still have it and I wear it often.,neutral
You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.,angry
"No I didn't, you worked the whole thing up in your jealous imagination.",neutral
You let him kiss you; you said you did.,angry
What of it?,neutral
"It gave him a lot of pleasure, it didn't hurt me any.",neutral
What about me?,angry
"Well, if you hadn't been so nosey and suspicious you never wouldn't have known anything about it.",neutral
No thanks.,neutral
I have a little I think.,neutral
"No particular reason. Anyhow, they are very small ones.",neutral
It just seems so silly to go on and on and on with such a thing.,neutral
You can hardly call three liquor glasses in a whole evening going on and on and on.,neutral
"Well, it's become a habit with you.",neutral
What?,angry
No I'm just making myself fascinating for you.,neutral
"Going out somewhere, dear?",neutral
"As a matter of fact, that's perfectly true.",neutral
Be quiet.,angry
I don't care. Do you understand? I don't care. I don't care if they bark or roll about like hoops.,angry
"Tell me, did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?",neutral
"Yes, I did quite a lot.",neutral
What riotous time you must have had.,angry
"No restraint at all, very enjoyable, never had much anyhow.",angry
Oh be quiet.,angry
"We can get a good little debate going about that, don't you think? Intemperate tots.",angry
All right. I will.,neutral
Better turn that off I think.,neutral
You are far too temperamental. Try to control yourself.,angry
Turn it off.,angry
Stop it. Stop it. I hate you.,angry
"Amanda, listen. Listen.",angry
"Listen indeed. I'm sick and tired of listening to you, damn sadistic bully.",angry
Very amusing indeed.,angry
"Stop it. Stop it. I hate you, do you hear? You're overbearing and conceited and utterly impossible.",angry
"You're a vile tempered, loose living, wicked little beast and I hope I never see you again as long as I live.",angry
"This is the end, do you hear? The end finally and forever.",angry
You're not going like this.,angry
Oh yes I am.,angry
You're not.,angry
"Yes, I am. Let go of me you're cruel fiend and I hate and loathe you. Thank God I realized who you really are before I would ever, ever marry you again. I would never marry you again. I'd rather die in torment.",angry
Shut up.,angry
Shut up.,angry
I wouldn't marry you again if you came to me on your bended knees. You're a evil minded little vampire. I hope to God I never see you again as long as I live.,angry
You're a beast. I hate you. Stop it. Stop it.,angry
"Oh, um-",neutral
What's wrong?,neutral
"You didn't fill this out right. All right. It says that you have to fill out the back sheet of this, but you filled out the yellow sheet of it.",neutral
Who?,neutral
She- she probably doesn't even work here.,neutral
All right Uh-,neutral
"How's it going, babe?",neutral
Yeah?,neutral
All right.,neutral
She's doing fine. She just took her first steps today actually. I videotaped it for you so you can watch it.,happy
And Uh- Yeah. Uh- They're going to need um- more nurses on call for uh- to go overseas to help out with the war.,sad

It's going- It's going to be probably in about three weeks.,sad
What? You can't do that. Three weeks?,surprise
yeah,sad
"I can't- No, I can't do this alone.",angry
"Yeah, and uh--",sad
"Honey, I'm going to come back. It's not like that.",sad
But it- it is for a year.,sad
"Babe, I'm sorry. But I don't want to do.",sad
"You know as much as -as much as me that I-I want to stay here with you and Amy so bad, but I can't.",sad
I have to work.,sad
"Babe, I love you.",sad
You can't leave your daughter alone like this.,sad
"But she has you. I mean, that's what you're there for. You're my right-hand man.",sad
It's going to be okay.,sad
You can't postpone it?,sad
"No, I have to go.",sad
"Wait, you can write me and as you know, send me pictures.",sad
I don't know if I can handle you going another year.,sad
What do you mean?,sad
I don't know if I- if I could take it.,sad
"Look, I need you to be strong for me. 'Cause I can't be the only one that's strong right now, really, I--",sad
I can't be that strong. A whole year.,sad
"me, oh my god.",sad
"and if we survive, if we survive that then babe, you know you know we could survive any--",sad
I will come back.,sad
It doesn't look very good.,sad
we'll have all the money that we ever needed.,sad
And- And then I'll stop working and- I'll stay home with the baby.,sad
I don't want the money. I want-you here,sad
If your life is going to be in danger and this family is going to be in danger we don't need the job. We'll find the money.,angry
It's all I ever knew how to do. I can't quit now.,sad
How are we supposed to tell Amy? How's she supposed to understand that?,sad
"Well, we- we tell her mommy's going on va- on a trip for for- a while.",sad
"How is she going to feel the first year in school, no mom.",sad
Don't do that to me.,sad
"It's hard enough already, Brian, I can't.",sad
I know.,sad
"I didn't expect this to happen. I never planned for this. Some things you just don't plan for, you know.",sad
"I'm sorry, babe.",sad
I'm so sorry.,sad
"All right, then.",sad

"No, you deserve to cry. I mean, tears of happiness.",happy

"But, I don't know, I--it's so weird to think I'm marrying somebody 'cause I feel so young, you know?",happy
No. No plans. or any- and probably,happy

Russel Crowe wasn't forty until he got his big stuff.,neutral
"If you really want to do it-I mean,",neutral
you got to do.,neutral
You could. You could. We just--,neutral
we're just pooling our funds together.,neutral
You don't owe me anything.,neutral
"You are, you're going to class, you're learning, you're getting better. When you finally get that role you're going to be prepared.",neutral
"Oh my God, Anna, you're still young. Don't even think about that.",neutral
"You're only twenty five, okay? Some people don't start until they're thirty five.",neutral
Really?,surprise
Yeah.,neutral
What would you do- What would you do if you didn't? You can go to law school.,neutral

Maybe you could start teaching. I don't know.,neutral
"Yeah, I guess I could.",sad
"Go back to school. You know? Another three more years, get your master's.",neutral
Yeah,sad
"Close to thirty. Oof, it's going to be tough.",neutral
"Where? I don't know. The lost and found. What do you mean, lost and found?",angry
"Oh, not--we didn't lose it; maybe the airport lost it. Maybe someone stole it.",neutral
"Wait, sir. You're- You're completely not--what do you mean, stole it? How can they just steal it from an airplane? It was up in the air?",angry
"What do you mean, if it shows up? No, I need it now. I have my keys, I have my wallet, I have my money. I have thousands and thousands of dollars worth of stuff in there.",angry
Not to mention I have my work in there.,angry
"And what if- what if it is lost? Well, what are you guys going to do for me?",angry
and when you sign your ticket we could replace about fifteen percent of what's in the bag.,neutral
Fifteen percent?,angry
Up to a limit of twenty five dollars.,neutral
What? There- There's hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of stuff in there.,angry

He was amazing.,sad
I loved that boy.,sad
"We did everything together, you know.",sad
"It's weird, I think. I feel so alone, you know? What am I going to do now? Now that he's gone.",sad
He's so young. It seems so--,sad

Not very good.,sad
"Can you imagine, though, you know, as a parent, just losing a kid? Twenty-two years old.",sad

Because this other half was just kind of like ripped away.,sad

I have some better news than that.,happy
"Yes, What would you want more than anything in this world?",happy
oh really?,surprise
oh yeah.,neutral
"and so, I mean, I got in.",happy
So now I can stay here and now we can party. I know.,happy
"We're not twenty one yet, but whatever.",neutral
Shit. That's-,surprise
"Oh, my God. That's--I heard it's top five-- --in the Grauman scale or something.",surprise
Yeah. It's really cool.,happy
Top five in the nation.,happy

But I'm going to definitely have to- uh--get your contact information,neutral

What? It's my phone. You can't even call me on it. I don't have another phone.,angry
"Okay, well, if you would like, um- we will be turning on the systems in probably about ten hours.",neutral
What? Are you kidding me?,angry
"Sir, I'm very sorry, but this is the way it is. This- We have no control over it. It's going to take- -but you have to be patient with us. You can use a calling card. We will give you a free calling card to use.",neutral

"Okay, well, we will send you- We will reimburse you for the amount of minutes that you-",neutral
-on average would use.,neutral
"That's it? Okay, yeah. What else?",angry
"And we will probably send you a calling card. I'm very sorry. You're just going to have to be patient, sir.",neutral
"Okay, I need more than this. Are you going to give me a little bit more?",angry
"No, we don't just give you things. We're- we're-",neutral

About three million dollars.,neutral

"Sir,",neutral
"what I would like what I'm advising you to do now is just to write down all of your problems that you-you feel that--You know, haven't been addressed, fax it to us-",neutral
and we will take care of it if anything happens. But all we can do now is ask for your patience.,neutral
Okay? Thank you for calling. Goodbye.,neutral
He saw it.,neutral
He was out there when it happened.,neutral
"Um, about four this morning. Uh- I heard a crack and I looked out and I saw him standing there.",neutral
I don't know. But after it cracked he went back in the house and he cried in the kitchen.,neutral
Did you talk to him?,neutral
"No, I uh-, I figured the best thing to do was to leave him alone.",neutral
"He cried hard, huh?",neutral
I could hear it right through the floor.,neutral
I guess he is.,neutral
"Could he-he's acting just like he did after he died, you know?",neutral
I don't know.,neutral
"But I know one thing, mom. We've made a terrible mistake with dad.",neutral
Being dishonest with him. That kind of thing always pays off and now it's paying off.,neutral
"What do you mean, dishonest?",neutral
They do come back.,neutral
"It's those Goddamn newspapers, you know? I mean, it's like every day they come out with this new person that comes along. And the next one's going to be Larry.",angry
"You know-you know why I asked Annie here, right?",neutral
Why?,neutral
You know.,neutral
I want to ask her to marry me.,neutral
"Well, that's only your business, Chris.",neutral
So it's all right. I'll just go ahead with it.,neutral
"See, then it's not just my business. God, you have",angry
"-Oh, you infuriate me sometimes. You know, it's not just my business too if dad throws a fit.",angry
"Every time I reach out for something I have to pull back because other people will suffer. My whole entire life, time and time after time.",sad
You're a considerate fella and there's nothing wrong in that.,neutral
To hell with that.,angry
There's nothing wrong with it.,neutral
I didn't ask Annie yet.,neutral
I wanted to get this settled first.,neutral
Well then I guess it's over then. But from her letters I think she's forgotten him.,neutral
"I'll find out. But then after it's all over we'll thrash it out with dad, right?",neutral
Because it is.,neutral
It just is. I-,neutral
But if I can't have that here then I'll get out.,neutral
I'll get out. I'll marry her somewhere else. Maybe New York.,neutral
Yes. I like it an hour out of the day. If I have to grub for money all day long at least that evening I want it beautiful. I want a wife. I want a family. I want some kids. I want to build something I can give myself to.,angry
"Now, Annie's in the middle of all that.",angry
"Now, where do I find it?",neutral
Tell me something.,neutral
You'd leave that business.,neutral
Yes. On this I would.,neutral
Then help me stay here.,neutral
Okay. Just-,neutral
I'm going to.,neutral
I am thinking like that.,neutral
"I don't know you, do I?",neutral
"No, you don't. I'm a pretty tough guy.",neutral
Yeah. I can see that.,neutral
Why did you invite her here?,angry
She's been in New York for three-and-a-half years. She don't just suddenly come and-,angry
"Well, maybe, maybe he just wanted to see her.",neutral
You don't travel seven hundred miles just to see.,angry
How do you know he's even thinking about it?,neutral
It's got that about it.,angry
"Well, so what?",neutral
She's not Larry's girl. She knows that.,angry
You can't read her mind.,neutral
How do you know why she's waited?,neutral
"She's faithful as a rock, don't you know. In my worst moments I can think of her-",sad
"Look, it's a nice day. What are we arguing for?",neutral
"Nobody in my house better ever dare-dare to challenge her faith. Maybe strangers, but not his father, not his brother.",angry
Calm yourself.,neutral
"Don't, don't laugh at me, don't laugh at me.",angry
"Look at it. Because why, when she came here and she slept in his room, the memorial broke into pieces. Look at it, look at it, Joe.",angry
All right. All right. Calm yourself.,angry
"No, you've got to believe.",sad
"Why me, above all?",angry
Huh?,angry
Why me above all?,angry
You got to keep believing.,sad
"Look at you, you're shaking.",angry
I can't help it.,sad
What have I got to hide?,angry
"Huh? What the hell's the matter with you, Kate?",angry
You're the only one I know that still loves his parents.,happy
"Yeah. I know. It went out of style, didn't it?",happy
"No, it's all right. There's nothing wrong in that, you know.",happy
It's really lovely here. The air is sweet.,happy
You're not sorry you came?,neutral
No. I'm not sorry. It's-,sad
Well-,neutral
What?,neutral
"Well, you've been embarrassed ever since I came.",sad
"Oh look, um, well, the thing is, I was planning on, planning on sort of sneaking up on you over a week or so, and they-they take it for granted we're all set.",happy
"I, I guess that's why I asked you to come.",happy
"Well, I mean,",happy
"Oh, Annie.",happy
"from her opinion, why else would I come here?",happy
"Annie, I love you.",happy
I love you a great deal.,happy
I-I love you. I have no imagination. That's all I know how to tell it.,happy
"Well, I guess that's why I came.",happy
"I'm embarrassing you. I didn't want to tell you it here. I wanted to go somewhere that would be brand-new to each other. It feels wrong here, don't you? This yard and this chair.",happy
I don't want to win you from anybody. I want you to be ready for me.,happy
"I've been ready for a long, long time.",happy
Why didn't you?,surprise
You felt something that far back?,happy
Every day since.,happy
Why didn't you let me know?,happy
"Give me a kiss, Annie.",happy
Give me-,happy
I don't know if I ever can forgive you for that. Why'd you wait so long? I sat in my room wondering if I was crazy for thinking about you.,happy
We're going to live now. I'm going to make you so happy.,happy
I kissed you.,happy
"Like Larry's brother. Do it like you, Chris.",happy
Let's drive somewhere. I want to be alone with you.,sad
No. What is it? Is it your mother?,sad
"No, no, no, no. Nothing like that.",neutral
"Well then tell me what's wrong. I mean, even in your letters there's something ashamed.",sad
"Yeah. I guess there is. I guess I was, but uh- it's going from me now.",sad
You should tell me.,sad
I don't know where to start.,sad
"But, Chris, it wouldn't work like this.",sad
You know when I went overseas. I said I was in command of a company.,sad
"Yeah, sure.",sad
"Well, I lost them.",sad
How many?,sad
Just about all.,sad
Geez.,sad
It takes a little while to toss that off. Because they weren't just men.,sad
"For instance, one time, it had to have been raining several days. There was this one kid, he came up to me and he gave me his last pair of dry socks. Put them in my pocket.",sad
"I mean, that's-that's only a little thing, but that's the kind of guys I had. They didn't just die. They killed themselves for each other. And I mean that exactly. A little more selfish and they'd still be here today.",sad
"And I, and I thought something watching them go down.",sad
"Everything was being destroyed, see, but there was one new thing that was being created. A kind of responsibility, man for man. You understand me?",sad
And to show that-to bring that onto the earth like some sort of monument standing right behind us where everyone could feel it and it would make a difference to him.,sad
And I came back here and it was incredible. There was no meaning in that here. The whole thing to them was a bus accident.,sad
And I went to work with dad and that rat race again. And I felt what you said-ashamed somehow. Because nobody was changed at all. It seemed to make a sucker out of a lot of guys.,sad
"And I felt wrong to be alive. To drive the car, to see the new checkbook, to see the new refrigerator. I mean, you can take those things out of the war. But you got to know that when you drive that car that that came out of the love a man can have for another man. And you got to be a little bit better because of that.",sad
"Otherwise, what you have here is loot; and there's blood on it.",sad
And I didn't want to take any of it.,sad
And I guess that included you.,sad
And you still feel that way?,sad
"Because you can't feel that way, never again, Chris. You hear me? Never. I mean, the money and me too.",sad
"Annie,",happy
"Annie, I'm going to make a fortune for you.",happy
What am I going to do with a fortune?,happy
Fine.,sad
"I don't understand why you're always saying oh, it's mine, it's mine. It's not like it's just your flashlight. I mean, how do you think that makes me feel?",angry
Do you want my jacket?,neutral
What? Are you kidding me? We just got here. We'd miss it. What's the point of coming down there if we just turn around and go home?,surprise
Right.,neutral
"Yeah, that's my point too.",neutral
"I mean, don't you want to see it?",neutral
Not particularly.,sad
Why not?,neutral
I don't know. I just don't.,sad
Pass up what? A bunch of fish. They swim up to the beach and they flop around and they swim away and then they die.,angry
For real?,surprise
About what I just said.,neutral
About what?,neutral
About what I was just saying.,neutral
"Carla, can I ask you something? Don't take this wrong, but are you having your period?",neutral
"Augie, Goddamn it, don't ask me that. You always ask me that. Why do you ask me that? I hate it. It's insulting.",angry
We're not seeing the grunions?,neutral
Like I feel like my whole life I've been just standing on this beach with my hands clasped waiting for these fish to show up and these fish never show up.,angry
Do you remember the last time we came here?,sad
We thought I was pregnant.,sad
You brought a bottle of champagne.,sad
We took off our shoes and we danced barefoot in the sand. Under the moon.,happy
And you whispered so intimately in my ear so I could feel your words.,happy
"Oh, that moment-that was it.",happy
"I told myself finally, this is how happy I'm supposed to be.",sad
Wait a minute. I got it.,neutral
Dancing barefoot in the sand. Drinking out of a bottle of champagne.,happy
I don't want to remember something.,sad
Hope for some things.,sad
No.,sad
No.,sad
"No, no.",sad
No.,angry
"A-a back rub, some ice cream, a suicide pact. What the hell do you want, Carla?",angry
"No, it's not. It's standing on the beach waiting and fighting.",angry
Things have never turned out anything the way that I thought they would be.,sad
it's not something else. Do you know what I'm trying to say?,sad
"I know you are, Augie, and I know you wanted this evening to be nice, but I can't help thinking of being somewhere else.",sad
I didn't say that.,sad
Yeah?,surprise
"Actually now that you mention it, no, I don't.",happy
"Well, I guess we're just in the wrong spart-spot with the right person.",happy
"Seemed like a pretty good spot to me. I mean, look at the view of the moon we've got from here.",happy
I noticed that. It's beautiful.,happy
You can see right over the water.,happy
Look what we got here.,happy
It's not champagne.,happy
At least we won't need glasses.,happy
Are you still cold? Do you want to go home?,neutral
Maybe this is the right place after all.,happy

The manager came in and found us rolling on the floor and biting and scratching like panthers. [LAUGHTER],happy
"As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.",angry
I knew nothing of the sort. You took presents from him.,angry
I remember it well. Bristling with diamonds. In the worst possible taste.,angry
"Just a little perhaps, but it was nothing serious.",neutral
You let him kiss you. You said so.,angry
What about me?,angry
"That's a nice point of view, I must say.",angry
"Well, it's true.",neutral
Are you bored with this conversation?,neutral
So am I. Bored stiff. Want some brandy?,neutral
"I'll have a little, I think.",neutral
"No particular reason. Anyhow, they were very small ones.",neutral
It's become a habit with you.,neutral
You needn't be so grand just because you don't happen to want some yourself at the moment.,angry
Don't be so stupid.,angry
"Really, Amanda.",angry
What?,angry
Nothing.,angry
"Going somewhere, dear?",angry
"It's a woman's job to allure the man. Watch me, won't you, a minute?",neutral
"No, it isn't.",angry
"Yes, it is.",angry
They snap.,angry
"I don't care. I don't care, do you understand? I don't care if they bark, if they roll over on the floor like hoops.",angry
did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?,angry
"I imagine that you let him kiss you quite a bit more then, didn't you?",angry
You had a riotous-must have had a riotous time. No restraint at all. Very enjoyable. You never had much anyhow.,angry
You are quite insufferable. I suppose it's because you're drunk.,angry
I'm not in the least bit drunk.,angry
"Okay. As I mentioned before, I said I had three very minute liquor glasses. That's hardly enough to get a child of two drunk.",angry
"Well, I suppose the people downstairs then.",angry
This is no time of the year for Tunis.,neutral
Turn it on.,angry
Turn it off.,angry
I will not. Go away. Go away. I hate you.,angry
"Oh, very amusing, indeed. Amanda, listen-",angry
"Listen, indeed. No, no, no, no. I am sick and tired of listening to you, you sadistic bully.",angry
Very amusing indeed.,angry
"Stop it, stop it, I hate you, I loath you, you are overbearing and conceited and utterly impossible.",angry
"You know, you're a vile, ill-tempered, wicked little beast and I hope that I never see you again as long as I live.",angry
This is the end. Do you hear? The end. Now and forever.,angry
"No, you're not going out like this. No you're not.",angry
"Oh, yes I am.",angry
"Yes I am. Let go of me. I hate you and I loath you. God, I can't believe I just finally realized how you are. I am never marry you. Never. Never, never, never. I would rather die in torment.",angry
"Oh, shut up. Shut up. Shut up.",angry
"I wouldn't marry you again if you came back crawling to me on your hands and knees because you're vile. You're a mean, evil-minded little vampire and I hope to God I never set eyes on you again.",angry
"Beast or brute cad, swine beast beast brute.",angry

"What do you mean. He couldn't have seen it. I was the first one up, he was still in bed.",surprise
He was out there when it happened.,sad
When?,surprise
About four in the morning. I heard a crack and I looked out and he was standing right there when it happened.,sad
I don't know. But after it cracked he ran back into the house and he cried in the kitchen.,sad
Did you talk to him?,sad
No. I figured the best thing to do was leave him alone.,sad
He cried hard?,sad
I could hear it right through the floor.,sad
I guess he is.,sad
"He's getting just like he did after he died, you know? What, what, what's the meaning of this?",sad
"I don't know. But I know one thing mom, we made a terrible mistake with dad.",sad
You know that Larry's not coming back and I know that too. Why we both go on letting him think that we both believe with him.,angry
"Why shouldn't he walk around and dream at him at night. Walk around. Why shouldn't he walk around? Why shouldn't he dream of him, walk around at night waiting for him? Do we contradict him? Do we say flat out that we don't have anymore hope?",angry
That we haven't had any hope for years now?,angry

Why?,angry
I want to ask her to marry me.,neutral
"Well what do you want me to do? I mean, you're old enough to know your own mind.",angry
Okay. So then it's alright. I'll go ahead with it.,neutral
"Well, I mean, you got to make sure your dad's not going--",neutral
Oh see then it's just not my business. God you infuriate me sometimes. Isn't my business too if dad throws a fit? Huh? God you have such a talent for ignoring things.,angry
Well to hell with that.,angry
Did you ask Annie yet?,neutral
I wanted to get this settled first.,neutral
Then I guess that's the end of it.,neutral
But from her letters I think she's forgotten him. I'll find out.,sad
"And then we'll thrash it out with dad right? Mom, don't avoid me.",neutral
"Look, you never had seen many, many women. You know? I mean...",neutral
I've given it three years of thought and I thought that if I waited then dad would forget about Larry and then we could have a regular wedding and everything happy.,sad
But if I can't have that here I'll get out.,neutral
I'll get out. I'll marry her somewhere else. Maybe New York.,neutral
I've been a good son too long. A good sucker and I'm through with it.,angry
You're just going to leave the business? You have a business here. You can't do that.,angry
The business doesn't inspire me.,angry
Yes. I like it an hour out of the day. If I have to grub for money all day long at least at evening I want it beautiful. I want a family. I want a wife. I want some kids. I want to build something I can give myself to.,angry
Tell me something. You can leave this business?,sad
Yes. On this I would.,neutral
"I mean what the hell have we worked for then? I mean, it's all for you Chris. The whole shooting match is for you.",angry
I know. Just you help me stay here.,sad
I am thinking like that.,sad
I don't understand you do I?,sad
No you don't. I'm a pretty tough guy.,sad
Yeah. I can see that.,sad
Why did he invite her here?,angry
Well she's been away for three and a half years in New York and suddenly she just shows up.,angry
"Well maybe, maybe he just wanted to see her.",neutral
Who said he even thought about that?,neutral
"Well, so what?",neutral
No. She's not his girl Joe and she knows that.,angry
How do you know why she's waited? Hmmm?,neutral
"I mean, her faith is stronger than a rock.",angry
"My worst times I think about her, you know, and I",sad
it's like I know as long as she's waiting I'm right again.,sad
"No. Nobody in my house better dare and challenge her faith. You know and maybe strangers but not his father, not his brother.",angry
"Laugh, laugh at me but I will. Because you know what happened when she came here? When she came back she slept in his room, the memorial broke into pieces. Joe, look. Look at it. You got to believe with me.",angry
"Look, it was just last week that Detroit, some boy came back he had been away longer than Larry, you can read it for yourself. You above all people have got to believe.",sad
"Alright, alright, calm yourself okay? Calm yourself. Wait, wait. What do you mean, me above all?",angry
"Wait, what does that mean? Me above all?",angry
"Look at you, you're shaking.",angry
I can't help it.,sad
What do I got to hide? Huh? What the hell's the matter with you Kate?,angry
You're not sorry you came?,neutral
No. I'm not sorry. But I'm not going to stay.,sad
Why?,surprise
"Look,",sad
"you saw the way that she acted and then well, I mean, you, you were acting kind of...",sad
What?,neutral
"Well, I don't know, embarrassed of her since I came.",sad
"I mean, that's the reason why I asked you here.",happy
"Well,",happy
I love you.,happy
I guess that's why I came.,happy
"Look, I've been ready for a long, long time now.",happy
"Look, I almost got married two years ago.",happy
You started to write me.,happy
You felt something that far back.,happy
Every day since.,happy
"I was waiting for you Chris, I mean, till then you never wrote and then when you did what did you say?",happy
You'd always be so ambiguous.,happy
"Give me a kiss Ann, just give me...",happy
I'll never forgive you for that.,happy
"I mean, Why did you wait all these years? There I was sitting around and wondering if I was crazy for thinking about you.",happy
We're going to live now. I'm going to make you so happy.,happy
Not like that you're not.,happy
"Nothing. Hey, let's drive somewhere. I want to be alone with you.",sad
You remember overseas I was in command of a company?,sad
Well I lost them.,sad
How many?,sad
Just about all.,sad
Geez.,sad
Takes a little while to toss that off cause they weren't just men.,sad
"For instance, one time this...it had been raining several days and this one kid, he came up to me, he gave me his last pair of dry socks, put them in my pocket.",sad
"That's just a little thing but that's the kind of guys I had. They didn't just die, they killed themselves for each other and I mean that exactly.",sad
A little more selfish and they'd still be here today. And I got this idea watching them go down. See everything was being destroyed but there was one new thing that was being created.,sad
"It was a kind of responsibility, man for man. You understand me?",sad
And to show that and to bring that onto the earth again like some sort of monument standing right behind all of us and we could feel it and it would make a difference to him.,sad
And then I came here and it was incredible. There was no meaning in it here. The whole thing to them was a kind of bus accident.,sad
"And I went to work with dad and that rat race again and I felt what you said, ashamed. Somehow because nobody was changed at all.",sad
"It seemed to make a sucker out of a lot of guys. I felt wrong to be alive. I felt wrong to have that new checkbook,",sad
"open that new bank account, drive the new car and see the new refrigerator",sad
"cause you can take those things out of the war. But you got to know, when you drive that car that it came out of the love that a man can have for a man and you got to be a little bit better because of that.",sad
Otherwise what you have is loot and there's blood on it.,sad
And I didn't want to take any of it and I guess that included you.,sad
And you still feel that way?,sad
"that includes me too, I mean and the money, you have right to that money. Your father put planes up in the air, good planes and he deserves it, you should be proud of that. A man should be paid for that.",sad
Annie I'm going to make a fortune for you.,happy
What am I going to do with a fortune?,happy
Buy some hats?,happy
Yes.,neutral
Do you want my jacket?,neutral
I'm just not.,neutral
About what?,angry
It's ridiculous.,angry
"It's PR. I mean, somebody sold you a good bill about this wonderful event that going to happen on the beach.",angry
"Yeah. Everyone else was sold the same thing. I mean, look, it keeps us excited, it keeps us coming back for more and you know, keeps us thinking life's going to start any minute now.",angry
"Look, I'm sorry but it's still just fish to me.",angry
Okay. Twice is as many times as we've tried and that's ever.,angry
"Augie, god dammit, don't ask me that. You always ask me that. I hate it when you ask me that. It's insulting.",angry
"Listen, I've waiting my entire life on this beach just standing there waiting for this fish to show up and these fish never show up.",angry
"Well, we're going to see it.",neutral
"No we won't. I mean, God, this isn't about the fish Augie.",angry
"Let's see I took a shower, you were watching the news, you said hey, hey the Grunions are running tonight and I said great let's go, I feel lucky tonight.",neutral
We thought I was pregnant.,sad
Wait a minute. I've got it.,neutral
It was in the car right? Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker...,neutral
And you said let's get some champagne and I said time's a wasting or something like that.,neutral
You want this to be like the other time right? That's it right?,neutral
I'd rather not remember something...,sad
Rather not hope for something.,sad
No.,sad
I want things to turn out the way that they're supposed to be.,angry
Welcome to the human race.,angry
Do you think that this is what I had in mind? That four years down the line that we'd get married and come to the beach and argue with each other over fish? No.,angry
I was just like you. I thought it was going to be all peaches and roses and everything great and the sand in our toes and the wind in our hair and the fish will always come and the bills will pay themselves and we'd have three big fat rosy kids...,angry
...and you know? Baby the jokes on us. Because you know what you get? Do you know what you get Carla? You get this.,angry
Yes it is.,angry
Right.,angry
Cause everything isn't anything like I thought it would be.,angry
This is just this. You know? I mean it's a lot and everything but it isn't somewhere else. Do you know what I'm trying to say?,sad
I know you are Augie. I know you wanted this evening to be nice.,sad
I can't help thinking about being somewhere else.,sad
Maybe if you were with someone else too.,sad
I didn't say that.,sad
I know. But I know I don't make you happy.,sad
"Augie, whatever I'm doing I'd rather be doing with you.",sad
If anybody wants to be with anybody else it's probably you. Probably somebody who enjoys herself a little more and is not so hard.,sad
"Well, I guess this is the wrong spot for the right people.",sad
I mean look at the view of the moon we got from here.,happy
Yeah. I noticed that. It's real pretty on the water.,happy
"Hey, look what we got here.",happy
Oh you brought refreshments.,happy
No I'm beginning to think you might be right.,happy
I think this may be the place for us after all.,happy
I am sorry Augie.,happy
Shh. If we're very quiet the fish might come.,happy
Or not.,happy
Or not.,happy
That's serious enough.,sad
I didn't hit you very hard.,neutral
"Oh, come on, you knew there was nothing in that.",neutral
Presents? A trivial little broach.,angry
You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.,angry
No I didn't. You made up the whole thing in your jealous imagination.,neutral
You must admit he was in love with you.,angry
Just a little perhaps but nothing serious.,neutral
You let him kiss you. You said so. What of it?,angry
"Well it didn't harm him, in fact, it pleasured him a lot and it didn't hurt me.",neutral
And what about me?,angry
"Oh, that's a nice point of view I must say.",angry
"Yeah, so am I. Bored stiff.",angry
You want some brandy?,neutral
I'll have a little I think.,neutral
I don't know why you want it. You've already had two glasses.,angry
No particular reason. Anyhow they were very small ones.,angry
I don't see what you have to go on and on with this kind of thing.,angry
Oh my...just because I just...okay...,angry
It's become a habit with you.,neutral
You needn't be so grand just because you don't happen to want any yourself at the moment.,angry
What?,angry
"No, just making myself beautiful for you.",neutral
That's the woman's job to lure the man. Watch me a moment won't you?,neutral
Actually that's perfectly true.,neutral
Yes it is.,neutral
I think that,neutral
"Adders don't snap, they sting.",angry
They sting.,angry
Mind your business.,angry
You're quite insufferable. I expect it's because you're drunk.,angry
I'm not in the least bit drunk.,angry
You've always had a weak head.,angry
"Okay, like I mentioned before I had three very small, minute liquor glasses of brandy. That's not even enough to get a child of two drunk.",angry
"On the contrary, a child of two can get violently drunk off just one glass of brandy.",angry
"Oh, what an interesting topic. What about a child of four and a child of six? A child of nine?",angry
Shut up.,angry
We might be able to bring up a splendid little debate about this intemperate tots.,angry
"Not very funny dear. In fact, maybe you better have some more brandy.",angry
"Oh, thanks. I think I will.",angry
You better turn that off.,angry
They are away in Tunis.,neutral
No I'll do no such thing.,angry
Very well. If you insist on being a boorish and idiotic.,angry
"Come on, turn it off. It's driving me mad.",angry
You are far too temperamental. Try to control yourself.,angry
Turn it--Turn it off.,angry
Go away. Go away. I hate you.,angry
Very amusing indeed.,angry
"I hate you. Listen I'm sick and tired of listening to you, you sadistic bully.",angry
"You know what? You're a vile, little, evil-minded, little, wicked beast and I never want to see you again.",angry
"This is the end. Understand? This is the end, here and now, forever and always.",angry
You're not going nowhere. No you're not.,angry
"Oh, yes I am. Yes I am and you can't stop me.",angry
Just shut up.,angry
shut up. shut up. I would-I would never marry you again if you came crawling back to me on your hands and knees because you're an evil-minded little vampire and I hope to God I never see you again.,angry
"Listen, you're a cruel fiend and I hate, loathe you. Thank God finally, finally thank God I've realized just how horrible you are--and marry you? Marry you? Never. I will never marry you. I will die die in torment-",angry
Beast. Brute. Cad. Swine. Beast. Beast. Brute. Devil. Sorry.,angry
Oh.,angry
I did exactly what they told me to do.,angry
I've got a life too ma'am,angry
There's nothing I can do for you. Do you understand that? Nothing.,angry
I've been to the back of the line five times.,angry
You're going to have to go back again.,angry
Okay. What is it that I did wrong on the form that I have to start all over again?,angry
"Okay. Well, I can do that right here right now without going to the back of the line again. See look initialed. All done. Ready to go.",angry
Ma'am I have other people waiting in line right now. I have other people waiting in line right now.,angry
I'm not starting over again. No I have done this five times. I am not starting over again.,angry
I mean look she's -she's perfectly nice. She doesn't mind waiting for a couple of minutes because I've been here all day. I have a job to get back to. I have kids to pick up from school. I can't just stay here.,angry
like I said before right now.,angry
This is your job is to help people like me who need to get a new license.,angry
You're testing my goddamn patience.,angry
I'm testing your patience?,angry
"I work in this fucking building all day. And I'm sick of it, okay?",angry
I don't need to be. I need to go and do other things with my time. Okay.,angry
"Please just put the form in, take the picture, let me get my license and get the hell out of here. Please.",angry
So you're leaving tomorrow.,sad
Yeah. They just called.,sad
This is really-this is unfair.,sad
I know.,sad
I don't know what to say. I don't want to go but I don't have a lot of choice.,sad
"And, uh, I'm afraid that if you, you know, when you leave, you won't come back.",sad
I'm going to come back. I need you to believe that.,sad
Well you have to have faith because I don't have a choice and I have to go.,sad
Do you think I want to leave you?,sad
I have to do this. I don't want to leave. Do you think I want to miss seeing her grow up?,sad
And now- and now it's really shitty timing but now I have to go.,sad
What's that supposed to mean?,sad
I mean we can't-we're not a complete family without you here.,sad
Well I'll come back. What is that supposed to mean? You're not willing to wait for me to come back?,angry
That's all I'm saying... No you don't.,angry
Thanks that helps.,angry
I feel much better now.,angry
"You're acting like, you know, you're the one who's going all through, you know, all this shit and it's really- it's really not.",angry
Yeah. Of course I do because I didn't enlist in this stupid thing. Why don't you just get out now and then-,angry
That's how you want to leave it?,angry
"I don't know how else to leave it. What, do you want me to lie to you?",sad
You want me tell you that I'm okay with it?,sad
I want you to be okay with it as much as you can be. I mean it's not a great situation but we don't have an option here.,sad
Well I can't be okay with it the same way you can't not go. It just doesn't work that way.,sad
Fine.,sad
What? You seem so excited.,neutral
"Uh, you got a new car, a new house. Uh, a dog.",neutral
Are you serious? You're getting married.,surprise
"Everybody's going to come up. We're going to stay in all the pretty cabins up there and, um, everybody's going to have, you know, really flowery sort of naturey stuff.",happy
Very Midsummer Night's wedding.,happy
Why not browns?,neutral
"It's a light brown, tanish.",neutral
I just think browns are really what you want to go with. I mean I think there's more contrast between brown and green than there is-,neutral
I know but you just asked me to-,neutral
Okay. Fine. So green and what?,neutral
Blue?,neutral
"Okay, fine. Greens and blues.",neutral
Greens and blues and maybe a little light yellow?,neutral
Yeah?,neutral
"Okay. That sounds good. Um, and, uh, we're going to get like a five, uh, story cake, right?",neutral
"I mean, you know, you're going to have at least, like, two hundred and fifty people come. So we're going to need, you know, just a huge buffet.",neutral
"Fried chicken, mashed potatoes.",neutral
Well I can't be in charge of this. I mean I got things I got to do.,neutral
"I don't know. Okay. I mean gosh. There's just- look there's a lot of pressure in getting married, okay.",neutral
That's helpful.,neutral
Well I guess you're not trying hard enough.,neutral
"Just, I don't know, maybe you're not smart enough.",neutral
I mean I don't know just go out and keep trying. Just-,neutral
I don't know.,neutral
"Hey. Look, I mean- you know.",neutral
I'm really good at what I do. I just don't know how to make someone else see that.,angry
Look bananas don't grow overnight. Okay.,neutral
What? Who says that? Bananas don't grow overnight.,angry
You need that- Time-,neutral
"You know- You need to just- you need, I mean it takes time to get a good job. I mean-",neutral
"look at me, like, you know. I mean, Hey, I- it took me, you know, like six years to get where I am now. I mean-",neutral
"Yeah but you weren't unemployed for three years trying to find any job. I mean at this point I'm going to go drive a cab or, you know, work at the gas station or something. I don't even- I don't know what to do anymore.",angry
Clearly everything you're doing is completely wrong.,angry
"I mean, well I mean i don't know; it doesn't really affect my life, you know.",neutral
"Yeah, I understand, but-",neutral
I don't even- I mean you have to have some kind of an idea. Something you could possibly throw out there that I could maybe use.,angry
"I don't know. Well like, I don't know. I mean-",neutral
I mean it's not like this is an,angry
extreme request. I want to find a job. Everybody wants to find a job. It's really not that.,angry
Clearly- cle- clearly you're doing something wrong.,neutral
"Okay. Okay, Fine.",angry
"'Cause if you've been looking, you've been applying for jobs for three years. And-",neutral
Okey So I'm doing something wrong. What am I doing wrong?,angry
I'm really good at what I do. I'm smart. I'm trained. I have the education. I'm talented. I cannot-,angry
Are you- I mean do you like get dressed up and everything when you go to the job interview?,neutral
"And you like- you know, you shave your legs and everything?",neutral
"and I want- I mean you know you've got to, like, do your hair. I mean- I don't know, it's like,",neutral
"you know what I mean? You know, it's like they say presentation is, like eighty percent.",neutral
or some- some large percent of- of success.,neutral
"Because I don't know I mean just, you know, just keep- keep- keep at it. Keep trying. Go-",neutral
Well you- just you're doing something wrong.,angry
"Hey, I'd love to help you but I- you don't have the kind of training that I-",neutral
Well you've got to start somewhere. I mean-,neutral
What's my problem? What's my problem? I don't have a job.,angry
I don't know it's like I'm trying to be-,neutral
I thought I was pretty clear about what the problem was.,angry
I'm trying to be helpful.,neutral
I'm trying to watch TV.,neutral
"Lost it just, like, I mean,",angry
it's not like it just disappeared into thin air. Somebody wasn't paying attention,angry
"because my bag was very easy to keep track of. It's got big, you know, rainbow colored crap all over it and no one was paying attention because now it's just gone.",angry
Wait. What?,surprise
No. No. I heard- I heard what you said.,angry
"You're kidding me, right. You're going to give me fifty dollars to completely cover my bag, everything that was in it, the inconvenience that I've gone through. I paid for my ticket. All I expect is to safely get to my destination with my stuff. Is that so much to ask? I mean I really don't think that's that big a deal to ask you guys to have my bag in the place where I leave and then put my bag where I end up.",angry
"Yeah, well that's got everything I have in it.",angry
Look fifty dollars is unacceptable. My bag itself cost over a hundred and fifty dollars. You can't just give me fifty dollar gift certificate to Percoes or whatever the hell and then send me off like that's- that's good enough. Like that's all I needed was fifty dollars. My bag is worth more than that.,angry
I expect your airline who was responsible for my bag to give me the equivalent of the bag and all of the things in it.,angry
I didn't sign anything. I didn't sign anything. And you people have got to make-,angry
You have to make amends for what you did for losing my bag and all of my stuff. Fifty dollars is unacceptable.,angry
No. No. I don't know. You know what? I'm going to call my lawyer. You know what? That's what I'm going to do. I'm going to call my lawyer and have him get down here and explain to you that this is an unacceptable option.,angry
I want to talk to your supervisor.,angry
"I've had enough. I want to talk to-no, no unacceptable I want to your supervisor. I am done with this.",angry
"Really, you don't work for anybody. It's just you?",angry
"Okay. Well I want to call whoever you report to, whoever your boss is because I have had enough with this airline and I am finished waiting for my fifty dollar gift certificate.",angry
"Hey, I'm, uh. I'm really sorry about what happened. I don't um- I mean what you can you do? I mean it's-",sad
Thanks.,sad
"When I was seven, my- my grandmother died and I really- I don't know, I mean it was really hard to let go but the important thing is- is that you do let go and your realize that, you know, they- you know, they- this person had fun while they were- while they were here and, uh, you know, you work- you work through it.",sad
"You know it's just, I just, you know, I mean it just happened. I just, like- I just keep expecting him to walk in, you know.",sad
Mmhmm. Yeah. Yeah. I mean it's- it's hard. It's hard.,sad
"I just- I just thought he would have longer, you know, because I'm- I mean when he found out he was sick, we knew that wasn't good but I just- I just thought that it would take longer, you know?",sad
Yeah.,sad
"Well I mean, you know, I mean it was I mean with that kind of condition,",neutral
Yeah. I know. I know.,sad
"you know, it's inevitable and I mean honestly it's- it's almost like",sad
"you know, you don't- you know, how long do you want the person to go through that, you know.",neutral
It's sort of- it's almost better off to rest in peace than he is to live in pain.,neutral
"Yeah, I know. But I'd rather have him here with me, you know. It's just not fair. I mean he- he didn't get to do like anything. I mean he was-",sad
"He was only twenty four and just so many things that we were going to do, you know, and now he won't get to do them and he won't get to be here when I do. You know, like I'll get married some day and he won't be there, like, he won't get to see that.",sad
Yeah.,sad
It just doesn't seem fair.,sad
"It's not fair but I mean that's, you know, the course of life is that, you know, you meet people and you lose them.",sad
You're okay,sad
Thank you for being here.,sad
You know I think- I think we should celebrate because I think that's what he would have wanted.,sad
[LAUGHTER] You're probably right. He probably would be pissed if we were all sitting around being upset about it. He'd want us to have a party.,happy
Yeah.,neutral
And to drink in his honor. [LAUGHTER],happy
"That's right. That's right. I mean he would want us to, you know, celebrate the life that he- that he lived and, you know, enjoy the rest of ours as much as we can.",sad
"Yeah, I know.",sad
So-,sad
"Hey, what's up?",neutral
Get out.,surprise
You serious?,surprise
I know but you should get like a taser or something. I mean walking around the campus at night-,neutral
"So, um- so what are you going to- what are you going to major in?",neutral
they have that as a major?,neutral
That's ridiculous. I don't believe that.,neutral
"Seriously, what's your major?",neutral
So you're undecided?,neutral
"Hey, that's cool.",neutral
"No, no. It's totally cool. I mean, like, this friend of mine he was- he's been undecided now for, like, the past like eleven years of his life.",neutral
"Uh, well-",neutral
You- you- you'll find.,neutral
"You'd have to, like go somewhere else, and, you know, we would be apart, and that would suck.",neutral
"Oh, that's right. Okay, I see. Right, right, right.",neutral
A party celebrating your acceptance.,neutral
That's cool.,neutral
"I don't know are you, like, I don't know. Are you, like, available or anything?",neutral
Okay. Putt-putt golfing?,neutral
Are you going to take out loans or-,neutral
"But, um-",neutral
"I mean, like, I don't know. I'm just saying if you need to make some extra cash. You can, you know",neutral
Or library.,neutral
I just said the library,neutral
"or, um, campus cruiser. You can drive people around.",neutral
Right or you can run for student counsel.,neutral
Dorky?,neutral
It's important.,neutral
Fine. It's dorky.,neutral
But that'll fit you because you're a dork.,neutral
"Yeah, you don't want to do the sorority thing because you'll probably get used and abused by",neutral
lots of drunk frat boys,neutral
Yeah.,neutral
"I mean it's not really free because you have to pay for it, but yeah.",neutral
Well do you think you're going to live on campus or off campus your first year?,neutral
"I hate to break this to you but you meet people by being cool, so-",neutral
"No, no, no. You're right though. I mean, you know, dorms are definitely the way to meet people. I know that I was in an apartment off campus",neutral
"that happened, you know, that was going on.",neutral
Hello. Thank you for calling Dell Taco Corporate. Can I help you?,happy
"Um, I basically, um I- I ordered some food",neutral
"Okay. Well, Did you go through the automated menu? Most of your requests can be taken care of through that.",neutral
Okay. Well I'd be happy to-,neutral
"Sir, can- can you tell me which branch you went to. We can start there.",neutral
"Okay. Um, and what was the complaint?",neutral
"Can you be a little more specific, sir?",neutral
"Well I'm very sorry, sir. They should have dealt with it at that particular branch. I apologize for that, uh, but we can help you. That's no worries. We can take care of that. So how much did you need to be refunded?",neutral
"It was a hundred a sixty dollars. I'm sorry, uh, sixteen dollars.",neutral
"Okay. Um, I'm going to go ahead and transfer you over to another department. They'll need your address.",neutral
"Look, I don't want to be transferred over to another- All I want to do is just give you my name and address so you can send me a check.",angry
"Okay. You understand that's all I want. Just don't give me a problem with this. Okay, please because I'm very sensitive right now",angry
"and if I get sent to another operator, I'll have to tell them the same damn story again. I don't- I think I'm just going to lose my mind. So if you could please just not do that, that would be great. Thank you.",angry
You don't understand because you've never gone to Del Taco and gotten the service that I've gotten. You don't understand.,angry
You're not going to call the other operator. You're not going to call the the other operator.,angry
You're going to fill out a form on your desk,angry
because I know you're at a desk right now in your stupid corporate building and you're going to send me a check for sixteen dollars and forty two cents.,angry
Cindy? Cindy what?,angry
"Cindy, look. If you don't get your ass a piece of paper that has a check",angry
"attached to it and you don't send it to me, I'm going to get very upset.",angry
But I'm giving you what you want.,angry
He saw it.,neutral
How could he see it? I was the first one up. He was still in bed.,surprise
Did you talk to him?,sad
"No, I figured the best thing was to leave him alone.",sad
I could hear him right through the floor of my room.,sad
What?,surprise
You know that Larry's not coming back and I know it. Why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him?,angry
"What do you want to do, argue with him?",angry
I don't want to argue with him but it's time that he realizes that Larry's not coming back anymore.,angry
You can't say that to him.,angry
We've got to say it to him.,angry
How are you going to prove it? Can you prove it?,angry
For God's sake three years. Nobody comes back after three years. It's insane.,angry
To you it is and to me but not to him. You can talk yourself blue in the face but there's no body and no grave so where are you?,angry
The trouble is the goddamn newspapers. Every month some boy turns up from nowhere so the next one is going to be Larry.,angry
You know why.,neutral
I'm going to ask her to marry me.,neutral
"Well that's only your business, Chris.",neutral
What do you want me to do? You're old enough to know your own mind.,angry
Then it isn't just my business.,angry
Sometimes you infuriate me. You know that? Isn't it your business too if I tell this to father and he throws a fit about it.,angry
Sometimes you have a- Sometimes you have a talent for ignoring things.,angry
I ignore what I got to ignore. The girl is Larry's girl.,angry
"From father's point of view, he's not dead and you have no right to take his girl.",angry
"Now you can go on from there and you know where to go, but I'm telling you I don't know where to go. See I don't know. Now what can I do for you?",angry
You're a considerate fellow. There's nothing wrong in that.,neutral
To hell with that.,angry
I wanted to get this settled first.,sad
"and then we'll thrash it out with dad, right mom. Don't avoid me.",angry
So what I'm not fast with women.,angry
I don't see why it has to be Annie.,angry
Because it is.,angry
Well that's a good answer but it don't answer anything. You haven't seen her since you went to war. It's been five years.,angry
"These years when I think of someone for my wife, I think of Annie. What do you want, a diagram?",sad
You marry that girl. You're pronouncing him dead. Now what happens to your father? Do you know because I don't?,angry
"I've given it three years of thought. I hoped that if I waited, dad would forget about Larry",angry
Are you crazy?,angry
You've got a business here. What the hell is this?,angry
"The business, the business doesn't inspire me.",angry
Must you be inspired?,angry
Alright but don't think that way,angry
"because what the hell did we work for? This whole shooting match is just for you, Chris.",angry
But don't think that way. You hear me?,angry
Yeah. I can see that.,angry
Why did he invite her?,angry
Why does that bother you?,neutral
It's been three years. Why all of a sudden?,angry
Well maybe- maybe he just wanted to see her again.,neutral
How do you know he's even thinking about it?,neutral
"What's going on here, Joe?",angry
"No, line.",angry
"Uh, Then why is she still-she's not his girl, Joe",neutral
"She's not his girl, Joe. She knows she's not.",angry
You can't read her mind.,neutral
Then why is she still single? New York is full of men. Why hasn't she married?,angry
Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish but she's waited.,angry
Because she knows what I know that's why. She's faithful as a rock.,angry
"She goes to sleep in his room and his memorial breaks in pieces. Look, look at it. Joe-",angry
"What does that mean, me above all? Look at you. You're shaking.",angry
What?,angry
I guess you know this is why I asked you to come.,neutral
I guess this is why I came.,happy
"Ann, I love you. I love you a great deal. I love you.",happy
I have no imagination that's all I know to tell you.,happy
I'm embarrassing you. I didn't want to tell it to you here. I,happy
"Chris, I've been ready a long, long time.",happy
And he's gone forever. You're sure?,neutral
You started to write me.,happy
Every day since.,happy
"I was waiting for you, Chris. Till then you never wrote and then when you did what did you say. I mean you sure can be ambiguous you know.",happy
"Give me a kiss, Ann. Give me a-God I kissed you.",happy
"I kissed Annie. How long, how long I've been waiting to kiss you.",happy
I'll never forgive you. Why did you wait all these years? All I've done is sit and wonder if I was crazy for thinking of you.,happy
"Annie, we're going to live now. I'm going to make you so happy.",happy
"No, nothing like that.",sad
Yes. I suppose I have been but it's going from me.,sad
There's so many things mixed up.,sad
You remember overseas I was in command of a company?,sad
"Yeah, sure.",neutral
Well I lost them.,sad
How many?,sad
Just about all.,sad
It takes a lot of time to toss that off because they weren't just men.,sad
"For instance, one time it had been raining several days and this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks.",sad
I put them in my pocket. that's only a little thing but these are the kind of guys I had.,sad
They didn't die. They killed themselves for each other. I mean that exactly. A little more selfish and they'd have been here today.,sad
"And I got this idea watching them go down. Everything was being destroyed see, but it seemed to me that there was one new thing that was made",sad
a sort of responsibility man for man. You understand me?,sad
And then I came home and it was amazing.,sad
"I felt, what you said, ashamed somehow",sad
because nobody was changed at all. It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys.,sad
"I felt wrong to be alive, to open the new bank book, to drive the new car, to see the new refrigerator.",sad
"when you drive the new car, you have to know that it came out of the love a man can have for a man. You've got to be a little better because of that.",sad
Otherwise what you have is really just loot and there's blood on it. I didn't want to take any of it.,sad
I guess that included you.,sad
"Annie, Annie I'm going to make a fortune for you.",happy
What'll I do with a fortune?,happy
What time is it? They're supposed to run around midnight. This is great isn't it? Look at this night we've got here. It couldn't be better.,happy
Fine.,neutral
Whose is it?,surprise
"Are you cold? Do you want my jacket? We should have brought the blanket, our blanket.",neutral
"Ah, this is great, isn't it? I didn't even think to bring a six-pack. A six-pack would be just the ticket right about now.",happy
It's after eleven let's go home.,angry
There is no point in coming down here.,angry
That's my point too.,neutral
I just don't. It's stupid.,angry
"Pass up what? These little fish swim onto the beach, flop around, and then swim away and then they die.",angry
What are you so excited about? This isn't a moon landing we're talking about. It's fish. It's fish nobody even eats.,angry
I'm just not.,angry
For real?,surprise
Yes.,angry
We didn't see them the first time either.,angry
We just weren't in a good spot. This is a much better spot.,angry
About what?,angry
It's ridiculous.,angry
"Well, so what do you think?",neutral
It's PR. Somebody sold you a bill of goods that this wonderful event is going to take place on the beach.,angry
Goddamn it Augie don't ask me that. You always ask me that. I hate it when you ask me that. It's insulting.,angry
We just have different ideas about what this evening is supposed to look like.,angry
"For heaven's sake, this is not about fish.",angry
We totally skipped. Right.,neutral
"For heaven's sake, grow up we are not going to see the Grunions.",angry
We never do. Do we have we ever?,angry
Twice is every time we've tried that's ever.,angry
and the fish won't show up.,angry
We thought I was pregnant and we had a bottle of champagne but no glasses. You asked me to dance. So we took off our shoes,sad
"and you popped the cork and while we were dancing, you said the softest most intimate things to me",sad
right into my ear so that I could hear them as much as- so that I could feel them as much as hear them.,sad
"And I remember thinking this is it. At last, at last I'm as happy as I'm supposed to be.",sad
Wait a minute. I've got it.,neutral
"Dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne from the bottle.",sad
"It was in the car right. Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said let's get some champagne and I said times a wasting or something like that. Right?",neutral
I would rather not remember some things. I would rather not hope for some things.,sad
No.,neutral
You want me to get some champagne?,neutral
No.,sad
No.,angry
"This what, what is this? This isn't even anything.",angry
"Oh, right, sure this is standing on the beach. This is waiting. This is fighting.",angry
"I know you are, Augie. Really I do. I know you wanted this to be special and nice and it's the full moon and the sand and all but I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else.",sad
Maybe if you were with somebody else too.,sad
"No, I know but still. I know I don't make you happy.",sad
Yeah?,surprise
somebody who knew how to enjoy herself and didn't take everything so hard.,sad
"Actually now that you mention it, no I don't.",neutral
I don't know. It seemed like a good spot to me.,neutral
"Yeah, I noticed that. Looks pretty on the water doesn't it, big old white moon.",happy
"Oh, Augie you brought refreshments.",happy
It's not champagne.,neutral
Well then I guess we don't need glasses.,happy
I'm beginning to think you might be right. I think this may be the spot after all. Augie I'm sorry.,happy
I wonder.,fear
It must be them then.,fear
"Don't say that, my darling.",neutral
Who's they?,neutral
Well who knows?,neutral
What happens if one of us dies? Does the one that's left still laugh?,neutral
Do you remember that awful scene in Venice?,neutral
The one where you bought that little painted wooden snake and put it on my bed.,neutral
Horrible thing. I hated it.,neutral
How long did that row last?,neutral
The worst one was in Cannes when your curling irons burnt holes in my dressing gown.,neutral
"As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.",neutral
I knew nothing of the sort. You took presents from him.,angry
You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.,angry
You let him kiss you. You said you did.,angry
What of it?,angry
What of it?,angry
What about me?,angry
"That's a nice point of view, I must say.",angry
"I'll have some myself, I think.",neutral
It's become a habit with you.,angry
"Oh, don't be so stupid.",angry
"Really, Amanda.",angry
What?,angry
Nothing.,angry
"Going somewhere, my dear?",angry
It doesn't seem to have worked such wonders with you.,angry
Adders don't snap they sting.,angry
They sting.,angry
"I don't care, okay. Do you understand? I don't care. I don't mind if they bark and roll about like hoops.",angry
Did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?,neutral
"Yes, I did quite a lot.",angry
Mind your own business.,angry
You're quite insufferable. I expect it's because you're drunk.,angry
I'm not in the least drunk.,angry
You always had a weak head.,angry
"On, the contrary. A child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy.",angry
"Oh, shut up.",angry
"Not very funny, dear. You'd better have some more brandy.",angry
Very good idea. I will.,angry
Why?,angry
There is no one upstairs. It's a photographer's studio.,angry
There are people downstairs I suppose.,angry
This is no time of year for Tunis.,angry
Very well if you insist on being boorish and idiotic.,angry
Turn it off. It's driving me mad.,angry
You're far too temperamental. Try to control yourself.,angry
"Go away, go away. I hate you.",angry
"Amanda, listen.",angry
Listen? Listen indeed. I'm sick and tired of listening to you. You damn sadistic bully.,angry
Stop.,angry
Very amusing.,angry
"Stop, stop. I hate you. Do you hear? You're conceited and overbearing and utterly impossible.",angry
"You're a vile tempered, loose living, wicked little beast. And I hope I never see you again as long as I live.",angry
"This is the end do you understand? The end,",angry
You're not going like this.,angry
finally and forever,angry
"Oh, I am. Let go of me.",angry
You're not.,angry
"Oh, I hate you. It's a good thing that I found out in time what you're really like. Marry you again? Never, never, never.",angry
Shut up. Shut up. I wouldn't marry you again if you came crawling to me on your bended knees.,angry
"You're a mean, evil minded, little tempered witch. I hope to God I never set eyes on you again as long as I live. Whore.",angry
I'd rather die in torment. Beast. Brute. Calf swine.,angry
"Yeah, hi. Um, look, I -- all I'm trying to do right now is renew my license plate. That's all. I just need to get one of those little stickers.",neutral
Okay. What's the problem?,neutral
"Okay, um. Do you have your photo ID with you?",neutral
"Yes, I do.",neutral
Okay. This is the wrong form. I'm sorry.,neutral
twenty bucks? Please. Go get in that line over there.,neutral
It's not rocket science.,angry
So go get in the other line or leave. Or I will have you escorted out by security.,angry
Would you like to be kicked out of the D.M.V.? You don't think that'll be a little embarrassing?,angry
"Okay, fine. I'll go over there. Thanks, a lot. You've been really helpful.",angry
Yeah. Thank you. Have a pleasant day.,angry
It's only going to be a year.,sad
"There's nothing I can do. I mean, I have to go.",neutral
You won't even know your child when you come back. This -- isn't there someone you could talk to?,sad
When do you leave?,sad
A week. You're giving me a week to be okay with this.,angry
"Well I didn't want it to be like cheesy, you know.",happy
"She didn't cry, but she was laughing a lot and it was very exciting, so...",happy
"Honestly, it was kind of quickly. It was actually only in the past couple months.",happy
"Yeah. Yeah. So- I know. I know. I know. It's weird 'cause it's like the beginning of the rest of my life, you know.",happy
"But uh- no, I mean, you know. You know, I really want you to like, you know, sort of",happy
"Yeah, I don't know. [LAUGHTER] But, yeah, so anyway -- well I wanted to tell you that, you know, 'cause you're one of my good friends and you're Kate's- one of her best friends and-",happy
"Yeah, yeah. She was actually -- she was going to tell you but I told her that I wanted to tell you and she had to work today anyway, so I decided to-",happy
"Yeah, yeah.",happy
"But, you know, it's like I really love her and I really just -- I can't imagine spending my life with anybody else but her. So, you know, it's like I know that's the right thing. And if you have to, you know, if you have to question that, you know, don't- don't do it. So we're going to do it.",happy
"And it's going to -- the -- you know, I told her that I just -- I want the color brown to be as an integral in the wedding. And, um, maybe some greens and blues.",happy
She's okay with it.,happy
"Well, I mean I just told her--Well I just said, you know, hey, these are my suggestions.",happy
All fruit and the color brown. Just that. That's all- that's my only request.,happy
This is why men don't plan weddings. [LAUGHTER],happy
Yeah. Well maybe--maybe you're right. Maybe there's something to that.,happy
"So, um, anyway, do you want to order now? So, um I mean--",neutral
Well there has to be something you haven't tried.,neutral
What about like a temp agency?,neutral
"Have you gone, like, signed up with a temp agency? Maybe they can help.",neutral
"there's just like no jobs available. I mean, it's just like, God.",neutral
"Right, but you have -- I mean, you have to keep on them. You have to keep calling and reminding them that you're still looking and",neutral
"I mean, you have to be really aggressive about it.",neutral
"Well, I mean, if it's that bad, maybe you're gonna have to take something that doesn't really fit, you know. Like maybe you'll have to do something else for a while. Find a new field, new skill.",neutral
"Well then you're choosing to be unemployed, really.",neutral
"If you're not willing to try and work with it and find something and, you know, I mean, there are things you could do.",neutral
"Well maybe, you know, your luck it is just down and the market for your particular field is down and maybe you just need to look into doing something else for a while.",neutral
"I mean, I'm not saying that you should, you know--",neutral
Excuse me?,surprise
It's my fault 'cause you didn't do what I told you to?,neutral
Well that sounds like your fault.,neutral
You didn't do what I told you to do.,neutral
"Well, I mean, it makes sense, doesn't it, hmm?",neutral
I think maybe you can't get employed because you aren't willing to take responsibility for your own actions.,neutral
That's not true. I take responsibility for my own actions.,neutral
Really? Whose fault is it you don't have a job?,neutral
Yours. I don't--,neutral
[LAUGHTER],neutral
"Hi, how can I help you?",neutral
Mmhmm.,neutral
I'm sorry.,neutral
Right.,neutral
"Uh. Okay. I -- first of all, I'm very sorry you lost your bag.",neutral
"Um, but, actually, our policy is a fifty dollar",neutral
fifty dollars?,angry
refund--coverage of the bag that was lost. yes,neutral
"fifty dollars. No way, no.",angry
"That's our policy, sir.",neutral
"I don't but the thing is, I don't care about your policy.",angry
You understand?,angry
I can't do that.,neutral
"No, no, because, look, I don't care what your policy says. I mean--",angry
You understand that the contents of my bag- The contents of my bag cost a hundred and fifty dollars.,angry
You--,angry
We'll cover fifty.,neutral
No. No. No. What I need you to do -- I need you to write checks for -- I need you to write three of them. That'll be satisfactory.,angry
"Just -- you can fill out the form--We can fill out - no, no, no, we can fill out the form three times.",angry
I'm very sorry. I understand you're upset. You just got off a long flight.,neutral
I understand that. I would know if it was mine. Um-,neutral
"Yeah. If it was yours, but it's not. It's mine. Okay. So just--",angry
But it's not. It's yours. I understand.,neutral
but I need to speak to somebody who can make the three check thing happen.,angry
"I understand you're frustrated, but--",neutral
I know. I understand it's personal-- It's personal to you. I get that.,neutral
Please.,angry
"I'm already calm. Okay, I'm calm. I'm calm.",angry
"Yeah. If you were really sorry, you'd give me the three checks.",angry
"So why don't we just do that and stop this nonsense, hmm? Hmm?",angry
"Hey, how you doing?",sad
I'm sorry.,sad
Thanks.,sad
"I know- I know there's nothing I can say that will really help, but--",sad
"I know. I just -- I don't know. It's just weird because you have somebody who's, you know,",sad
a major part of your life and then they're gone. And I don't know. That's not really -- it's never really happened to me before.,sad
I'm sorry. It's never easy.,sad
Yeah.,sad
"But, I'm here if there's anything you need. I mean, you just have to ask. I know --",sad
Thanks.,sad
--it doesn't really do anything. But--,sad
I just -- it's just not fair.,sad
I know. It never is.,sad
"How's, um -- how's his parents doing?",sad
"I mean, they're, you know, they're upset. It's like you know, they",sad
feel the same way everybody else does.,sad
"I mean, what do you want to do? Do you want to- do you want to talk about it? Do you-",sad
"[BREATHING] I mean, there's nothing really to talk about. He's gone and I'll never see him again.",sad
"Well I know it's not a lot of help or anything, but at least you got to know him. I mean, at least you had the time with him that you did.",sad
Yeah.,sad
"I mean, we can be grateful for that.",sad
"Yeah, I don't know. Sometimes I wish I didn't know him. So I wouldn't--",sad
You feel that way now because you're upset. But you don't really think that.,sad
"It'll get better. I know it doesn't help, but it will get better and you will remember all of the good things that you guys had; all of the memories that you have with him that were happy and you'll be grateful for those.",sad
This is just -- this is a terrible life. I just don't understand.,sad
"I mean, it's just not fair. Like, I don't know. Why people -",sad
"there should just be some sort of rule that people don't die until they're older, 'cause then, at least, it's expected.",sad
"I agree. If I knew how to make that happen, I would certainly help you.",sad
I don't know what to do.,sad
"When's the service? Can- can we help? Is there anything, I mean--",sad
"I mean, you- you can go. I don't know. I don't know what else.",sad
I hope it rains. Somehow that'll make me feel more comfortable.,sad
"Seems like if the whole world's sad, then it's okay for you to be.",sad
Yeah.,sad
I just wish there was some way to just bring him back to life magically.,sad
I know.,sad
"Just, you know, some thing; some genie. I need to find a genie bottle.",sad
"I don't have any magic answers. But,",sad
"I mean, as- as cliche as it is, as long as people who loved him remember him, then it's not a waste, you know.",sad
I know.,sad
"What, no way.",surprise
Really?,surprise
"Yeah. I like to know about history, 'cause, you know, it's- it's just so relevant to the present.",happy
Yeah.,happy
"And, uh-",happy
"Um, you know, I don't think so. But I think that, you know, it's still a private school",happy
"and right you know it's still- and then, you know, I mean-",happy
"I'm guessing, you know it's like I I checked it out. And, like, they have a decent history program.",happy
"So -- and like the geology just is awesome. It rocks, no pun intended. [LAUGHTER]",happy
"Oh, you did not just say that.",happy
"Ouch. That's, um -- oh, wow.",neutral
"No, no, I mean, I didn't know -- I didn't know that about you. Um, I feel like --",neutral
"The -- what, the- I mean--",neutral
I'll go to basketball games.,neutral
"Okay. Well that's cool, too, but like--",neutral
Maybe some golf matches.,neutral
I don't know. Do they have golf? Do they have- Does U.S.C. have a -- I don't know if they have a golf team.,neutral
"No, I'm not going to go to a football game.",neutral
Forget it. Forget it. Forget it. No way.,neutral
I do -- I will need to get a gun-,neutral
"Okay. Um, but, no, I, uh, I do need to get a gun soon, though, 'cause I mean",neutral
Excuse me?,neutral
I need to get like a -- just a small little gun just 'cause -- or like a taser or something or just like a butterfly knife,neutral
No.,neutral
"'cause, you know, I mean, it's like If I ever want to go south of campus",neutral
Well I need to defend myself from,neutral
Are you sure you didn't make them?,neutral
Okay.,neutral
"Umm, Miss Aruckman",neutral
I am seeing the two hundred dollar charge.,neutral
So you're saying that you didn't make these calls.,neutral
All I can do for you right now is give you a hundred dollars.,neutral
What I can,neutral
What I can do for you is give you a hundred dollars right now and fill out complaint form,neutral
which you- which you'll have to go into a local Verizon dealer-- or Sprint.,neutral
A few weeks. You won't even know that they were there.,neutral
Really?,surprise
"Yeah. That's fine. I just -- that's fine. Yeah, I mean, it doesn't make any difference to me. I mean, it's not like it's going to cost my job or anything.",neutral
You're just going to put it back on my account.,neutral
"I mean, technically, that's policy. But, like, I mean, I don't really care about -- nobody really cares about policy here.",neutral
So you're just going to take care of this for me?,surprise
Sure.,neutral
"Oh, my God, thank you so much.",happy
You're welcome.,neutral

"God, that's like a whole problem with like-- But, no, I mean, hey-- if you ever",neutral
"if you ever come out to Montgomery, I mean, you know, just -- just call up, you know, call up the operator and I'll-- I'll be here. So, um.",neutral
I'll,neutral
"call up the Sprint call center and, uh, you know. cool",neutral
Alright. Take Care.,neutral
You too.,neutral
What's he going to say? Maybe we ought to tell him before he sees it.,neutral
He saw it.,neutral
He was out here when it broke.,neutral
When?,surprise
He's getting just like after he died. What's the meaning in that?,sad
What?,surprise
You can't say that to him.,angry
We've gotta say it to him.,angry
How are you going to prove it? Can you prove it?,angry
"For God's sake, three years. Nobody comes back after three years. It's insane.",angry
"To you it is and to me, but not to him. You can talk yourself blue in the face, but there's no body and no grave, so where are you?",angry
Why?,neutral
Going to ask her to marry me.,neutral
"Well that's only your business, Chris.",neutral
What do you want me to do? You're old enough to know your own mind.,angry
Well you want to make sure your father isn't going to have --,neutral
"Well, then you know it's not only my business.",angry
"Sometimes you infuriate me, you know that? Isn't it your business, too, if I tell this to father and he throws a fit about it? You have such a talent for ignoring things.",angry
I ignore what I got to ignore. The girl is Larry's girl.,angry
"From father's point of view, he's not dead. And you have no right to take his girl.",angry
I wanted to get this settled first.,neutral
How do you know she'll marry you? Maybe she feels the same way father does.,neutral
"The trouble is, you don't see enough women. You never did.",neutral
I don't see why it has to be Annie.,angry
"Alright, then, mom. Did we skip something? No. Alright, then, mom.",neutral
Yes we did. Do you want to keep going?,neutral
"Yeah, let's keep going.",neutral
Just give it some more thought.,neutral
"father forgot about Larry, we'd have a regular wedding and everything happy. If I can't get that here, then I'll have to get out.",sad
What the hell is this?,angry
Are you crazy?,angry
You've got a business here. What the hell is this?,angry
The business? The business doesn't inspire me.,angry
Must you be inspired?,angry
"Yes. I like getting an hour a day. If I have to grub for money all day long, at least at evening, I want it beautiful.",angry
"Yes, on this I would.",neutral
You don't want to think like that.,angry
Then you help me stay here.,neutral
"Alright. But just don't think like that because what the hell did we work for? That's all for you, Chris. The whole shooting match is just for you.",angry
"But don't think that way, you hear me?",angry
Why did he invite her here?,angry
"Oh, God, line.",neutral
Why does that bother you?,neutral
"She's been in New York three and a half years. Why, all of a sudden--",angry
Nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see.,angry
He's not going to marry her.,angry
How do you know he's even thinking about it?,neutral
It's got that about it.,angry
Well so what?,neutral
"What's going on here, Joe?",angry
Line.,neutral
"Now listen, kid. Now, listen.",neutral
"She's not his girl, Joe. She knows she's not.",angry
"Then why is she still single? New York is full of men. Why hasn't she married? Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish, but she's waited.",angry
"Because she knows what I know, that's why. She's faithful as a rock. In my worst moments, I think of her waiting and I know, again, that I'm right.",angry
"Nobody in this house dares take her faith away, Joe. Strangers might, but not his father, not his brother.",angry
"I want you to act like he's coming back, both of you. Don't think I haven't noticed you since he invited her here. I won't stand for any nonsense.",angry
"Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself.",angry
Laugh. Laugh at me. But why did that happen the very night that she came here?,angry
She goes to sleep in his bed and his memorial breaks in pieces. Look. Look at it. Joe--,angry
"Believe with me, Joe. I can't stand all alone",angry
"You, above all, have got to believe. You.",angry
I can't help it.,sad
"What have I got to hide? What the hell is the matter with you, Kate?",angry
Every day since.,happy
"I was waiting for you, Chris. 'Til then, you never wrote and when you did, what did you say? You sure can be ambiguous, you know.",happy
I'll never forgive you. Why did you wait all these years? All I've done is sit around and wonder if I was crazy for thinking of you.,happy
"Yes, I suppose there has been. But it's going from me.",sad
I don't know where to start.,sad
"It's all mixed up with so many other things. You remember overseas, I was in command of a company?",sad
Well I lost them.,sad
How many?,sad
Just about all.,sad
"Oh, gees.",sad
It takes a little time to toss that off because they weren't just men.,sad
"For instance, one time it'd been raining several days. And this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks; put them in my pocket. That's only a little thing, but that's the kind of guys I had.",sad
"And I got this idea watching them go down, everything was being destroyed, see? But, to me, it seemed there was one new thing that was made,",sad
a kind of responsibility. Man for man. You understand me? And then I went home and it was incredible.,sad
"There was no meaning in it here. The whole thing to them was some sort of bus accident. Then I went to work for dad and that whole rat race again. I felt, what you said, ashamed somehow",sad
because nobody was changed. It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys. I felt wrong to be alive;,sad
"to open that bank book; to drive the new car; to see the new refrigerator. I mean, you can take these things out of a war, but when you drive the new car, you have to know that it came out of the love a man can have for a man.",sad
"You have to be a little better because of that. Otherwise, we have is really loot and there's blood on it. I don't want to take any of it. I guess that included you.",sad
"Annie, Annie, I'm going to make you a fortune.",happy
What'll I do with a fortune?,happy

You want my jacket?,neutral
It's after eleven; let's go home.,angry
There is no point in coming down here.,angry
Right.,neutral

So let's go home.,angry

"Pass up what? These little fish swim onto the beach, flop around and then they swim away. And then they die.",angry
What are you so excited about?,neutral
For real?,surprise
Yes.,angry
"Last year, you will also remember, our shoes got wet. I got sand in my panties. We got into a big fight over nothing. You got a sore throat and we did not see the grunions.",angry
"Look at this, goose bumps.",neutral
Well so what'd you think?,neutral
What I said.,neutral
"Goddamn it, Augie, don't ask me that. I hate it when you ask me that. You always ask me that. It's insulting.",angry
Well what's bugging you?,angry
We just have different ideas about what this evening is supposed to look like.,angry
"There's nothing to it. We come down here. The grunions arrive. They do their little fish business. We go ooh, ah, look at the fish. They go home. We go home.",angry
"We never do, do we? Have we ever?",angry
"I did want to see it. I always do. I keep thinking this time will be the time, but it never is.",angry
"It was about four years ago, right after we got married. We thought I was pregnant and we had a bottle of champagne but no glasses. You asked me to dance. So we took off our shoes and you popped the cork.",sad
"Wait a minute, I've got it.",neutral
Dancing barefoot in the sand; drinking champagne from the bottle.,sad
"It was in the car, right? Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker? You said let's get some champagne and I said times a wasting or something like that. Right? That's it, right? You want this to be like the other time. That's it. Of course.",neutral
I'd rather not remember some things. I'd rather not hope for some things.,sad
No.,sad
No.,sad
No.,angry
I want something to turn out the way it's supposed to.,angry
"Well welcome to the human race. You think this is what I had in mind? You think that when I proposed, I had this great fantasy going that four years down the line, we'd come to the beach and yell at each other over fish? No.",angry
"And we'll have three fat rosy kids and ha, ha, ha, baby, the joke's on us, 'cause you know what you get, Carla? You know what you get? This.",angry
This what? What is this? This isn't even anything.,angry
"Oh, right, sure. This is standing on the beach. This is waiting. This is fighting.",angry
But this isn't anything like I thought anything would be like.,angry
"No, I know, me neither.",angry
I didn't say that.,sad

What are we to do?,fear
"We'll be alright, darling. Whatever happens, aren't we?",neutral
"Meaning that sacred and beautiful thing, love?",neutral
"You mustn't be serious, my dear. That's just what they want.",neutral
All the futile moralists who try to make life unbearable. Laugh at them. Be flippant. Laugh at everything. All their sacred shibboleths. Flippancy brings out the acid- acid in their damn sweetness and light.,angry
"If I laugh at everything, I must laugh at us, too.",neutral
No. That fire will fade along with our passion.,sad
Horrible thing. I hated it.,angry
Line?,neutral
"As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.",neutral
That was the first time you ever hit me.,angry
I didn't hit you very hard.,neutral
"The manager came in and found us rolling about on the floor, biting and scratching like panthers. Oh, dear.",happy
"How ridiculous. How utterly, utterly ridiculous.",happy
And very much sillier.,happy
"You must admit that he was in love with you, wasn't he?",angry
"Just a little, perhaps, nothing serious.",happy
Line?,neutral
Let him kiss you.,neutral
You let him kiss you. You said you did.,angry
What of it?,angry
What of it?,angry
What about me?,angry

It's become a habit with you.,angry
"Really, Amanda",angry
What?,angry
Nothing.,angry

"Oh, be quiet.",angry
Line?,neutral
It's a pity you didn't- It's a pity you didn't have more brandy.,neutral

"They -- nonsense, they have a little bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap.",angry
They snap.,angry
I don't care. Do you understand? I don't care. I don't mind if they bark and roll about like hoops.,angry
"Yes, I did, quite a lot.",angry
"I suppose you let him kiss you a good deal more then, hmm?",angry
Mind your own business.,angry
You must have had a riotous time.,angry
"No restraint at all, very enjoyable. You never had much anyhow.",angry
You're quite insufferable. I expected it's because you're drunk.,angry
I'm not in the least drunk.,angry
You always had a weak head.,angry
"On the contrary, a child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy.",angry
Very interesting. And how about a child of four and a child of six and a child of nine?,angry
"Oh, shut up.",angry
"Not very funny, dear. You'd better have some more brandy.",angry
Very good idea. I will,angry
You better turn that off I think.,angry
Why?,angry
There aren't any people upstairs. It's a photographer's studio.,angry
"There are people downstairs, I suppose",angry
"Turn it on again, please.",angry
"Very well, if you insist on being boorish and idiotic.",angry
Turn it off. It's driving me mad.,angry
Go away. Go away. I hate you.,angry
Turn it off.,angry
You are far too temperamental. Try to control yourself.,angry
We swapped. Listen.,neutral
Listen--,angry

Stop.,angry
wicked little beast. And I- I hope I never see you again as long as live.,angry
Stop. I hate you. Do you hear me? You're conceited and overbearing and utterly impossible.,angry
"This is the end. Do you understand, the end? Finally and forever.",angry
You're not going like this.,angry
"Oh, yes, I am.",angry
"No, you're not.",angry
"Let go of me. You're a cruel fiend and I hate and loath you. Thank God, I discovered in time what you're really like.",angry
Shut up. Shut up.,angry

"So could I maybe get the form from you, fill it out here- and maybe you could-",neutral
Isn't there anything you can do? Just call over and ask them if I can go to the front of the line in the other line.,angry
Why not?,angry

I don't think there's anything we can do.,sad
I'll tell them I'm sick and that you can't leave something.,sad

Have you asked Annie yet to marry you?,neutral
"Well how did you know that she will go along with it, I mean maybe she feels the same way as your father?",neutral
"The trouble is you don't see enough women, you never have",neutral
Well I just don't see why it has to be Annie.,neutral
"You marry his girl, and you're pronouncing him dead. Now what's going to happen to your father, do you know? I don't.",sad
What the hell is this?,angry
Are you crazy?,angry
The business? The business? It doesn't inspire me?,angry
"All right! But don't think like that, because I mean, what the hell did we do all this for, Chris? The whole business it's all for you! The whole shooting match is for you!",angry
Why does that bother you?,neutral
She's been in New York three and a half years. Why all of the sudden?,neutral
Well maybe. Maybe she just wanted to see her again.,neutral
"What did you mean? He lived next door to the girl all of his life, why wouldn't he want to see her again? Don't look at me like that, he didn't tell me any more than he told you.",neutral
She's not his girl. She knows she's not.,angry
I want you to pretend like he's coming back!,angry
"Because if he's not coming back, then I'll kill myself.",angry
"Laugh. Laugh at me, but what happens the night that she goes to sleep in his bed, and his memorial breaks in pieces?",angry
"Only last week, another boy turned up in Detroit, been missing longer than Larry, you read it yourself.",angry
You've got to believe. You've got to--,sad
What do you mean me above all? Look at you. You're shaking!,angry
I can't help it!,angry
"What have I got to hide? What the hell is the matter with you, Kate?",angry
You're the only one I know who loves his parents.,happy
I know. It's going out of style isn't it?,happy
"No, it's good.",happy
It's so lovely here. The air is sweet.,happy
No. But I'm not going to stay.,happy
Why?,surprise
What?,neutral
Well sort of embarrassed soon as I came.,sad
Well the plan was to kind of sneak up on you over a period of a week or so. But uh- they take it for granted that we're all set.,happy
How did you know?,neutral
"Well, from her point of view why else would I come?",neutral
I guess this is why I came.,happy
"Anne, I love you. I love you a great deal. I love you!",happy
I'll never forgive you. Why did you wait so long? All this time I've been wondering if I was a fool for thinking of you!,happy
"Not like that, you're not.",happy
"Like Larry's brother. Do it like you, Chris. Chris, what's the matter?",happy
"Yeah, I suppose I have been. But it's going from me.",sad
It wouldn't work like this.,sad
"It's- It's mixed up with so many other things, I-",sad
Remember when I was overseas? I was in command of the company.,sad
yeah sure.,neutral
Yeah. I lost them.,sad
how many?,sad
just about all.,sad
Oh gee.,sad
Takes a little time to toss something like that off you know because they weren't just men-,sad
"for instance, there's this one time. It had been raining for several days. And this kid came up to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks. you know, He just put them in my pocket.",sad
"I know that- that's not a big thing, but it's just the kind of guys I had. They didn't die. They- They killed themselves for each other.",sad
I mean that exactly that-a little more selfish and they would have still been here today.,sad
"And I got an ideal, watching them all go down. Everything was being destroyed see and-",sad
"but it seemed to me that something new was being created at the same time, a kind of responsibility, man for man. Do you understand me?",sad
And to show that-to-to bring that back onto the earth again like a- like a monument. And everyone would have it standing behind them and- and it would make a difference for them.,sad
And then I went home and it was incredible. It had no meaning here.,sad
"It was all like some kind of bus accident to them. I went back to work with my dad, in that whole rat race again.",sad
And I felt what you said- ashamed somehow-because nobody had changed at all. It seemed to make suckers out of a whole lot of guys. and,sad
"It felt wrong to be alive-to open that bank-book; to buy that new car; to look at that new refrigerator. I mean, you can take those things out of the war, but if you drive that car, you have to know that that comes from the love that a man has for a man. And you've got to be a little bit better than that!",sad
Do you still feel like that?,neutral
"Because you can't feel like that anymore Chris, you hear me? I mean everything that you have, you deserve. And that includes me. And your father? Your father put hundreds of planes in the air, you should be proud. A man should be paid for that.",sad
"Oh Annie. Annie, I am going to make you a fortune!",happy
What would I do with a fortune?,happy
Fine.,neutral
What flashlight?,neutral
yes.,neutral
"It's after eleven, let's go home.",neutral
Not particularly.,neutral
I just don't.,neutral
I am just not.,neutral
For real?,surprise
Yes.,neutral
It certainly is not. It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact.,neutral
"I am not the only one, look at all these people.",neutral
"Carla, can I ask you a question? Now don't be upset, are you having a period?",neutral
"God damn it, Augie. Why do you always ask things like that? It's so insulting.",angry
Well We will see them this year.,neutral
"Augie, do you remember the first time we came to see it? It was about four years ago right after we got married and we thought I was pregnant.",sad
"We had a bottle of champagne but no glasses and you ask me to dance so we took off our shoes and while we were dancing, you said the most intimate things right in my ears so I could feel them as much as hear them.",sad
"And I remember thinking, Finally, finally. I am as happy as I am supposed to be.",happy
"Wait a minute, I got it.",neutral
"Dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne from the bottle.",sad
I rather not remember some things. I rather not hope for some things.,sad
No.,sad
No.,sad
What. Welcome to the human race.,angry
This what? What is this? This isn't even anything.,sad
"Sure, this is standing. This is waiting. This is fighting.",sad
But this isn't anything like I thought it would be.,sad
"No, I know me either.",sad
"I mean it is just this , I mean it includes a lot and everything and you know it's the sand and it's the full moon and I just-I am sorry but I couldn't help wishing I was somewhere else.",sad
Maybe if you are with somebody else too?,sad
I didn't say that.,sad
"No, I know, but. I know I don't make you happy.",sad
"For heaven's sake Augie, wherever I am I always wanted to be with you.",sad
"Whatever I am doing, I wanted to be with you. I mean you are probably the one who wishes you were with somebody else, somebody who didn't take everything so hard and who knows how to enjoy herself.",sad
"Actually, now that you mention it. No, I don't.",happy
Good. So maybe we are on the wrong spot but we are with the right person.,happy
I don't know. Seems like a pretty good spot to me I mean look at the view of the moon you got from here.,happy
"Yes, I did notice that. It does look really beautiful on the water. The gold white moon.",happy
"Well, look what we have got here.",happy
"No, I am beginning to think that maybe this is the spot after all.",happy
"Shh, If we're very quiet, the fish might come.",happy
Or not.,happy
"Oh, what shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us?",fear
The whole business is really rather ridiculous.,neutral
Meaning exactly that.,neutral
Who's they?,neutral
"Well, what if-what happens when our love-",neutral
"Well, what if one of us dies, does the other laugh then?",neutral
"Oh, I didn't hit you very hard.",neutral
"Oh, ridiculous. utterly ridiculous",happy
You knew there was nothing.,neutral
You knew there was nothing in that.,neutral
Only a trivial little broach.,neutral
You worked the whole thing up in your jealous imagination.,neutral
"You must admit that he was in love with you, wasn't he?",angry
"maybe just a little, but--",neutral
You let him kiss you. You said you did.,angry
And what of it?,neutral
"Well, I- he got a lot of pleasure out of it and it didn't hurt me.",neutral
"Well, that's a nice point of view I must say.",angry
"So am I, bored stiff. Would you like some brandy?",neutral
I'll have a little I think.,neutral
I don't see why you want any. You've already had three glasses.,neutral
"Well, it seems silly to go on and on in such a thing.",neutral
It's becoming a habit with you.,neutral
You needn't be so grand simply because you don't happen to want any at the moment.,angry
"Really, Amanda.",angry
Just making myself fascinating for you.,neutral
"Oh, that reply has broken my heart.",angry
It's a pity you didn't take a little more brandy. It might have made you a little less disagreeable.,angry
"Um, It doesn't seem to have worked such wonders with you.",angry
"adder don't snap, they sting.",angry
They sting.,angry
They snap.,angry
"I don't care if they bark and roll around like hoops, okay.",angry
Did you see much of Peter Burden after the divorce?,angry
"Yes, I did quite a bit.",neutral
I suppose you let him kiss you a good deal more then.,angry
Mind your own business.,angry
"You must have a riotous time, no restraint at all, very enjoyable. I mean, you never had much anyway.",angry
"Oh dear, you really are becoming quite insufferable. I would imagine it's because you're drunk.",angry
"Not very funny, dear, you better have some more brandy.",angry
Why?,angry
There aren't any people upstairs; it's a photographer's studio.,angry
They're away in Tunis.,angry
Turn it on again.,angry
"Fine, if you insist on being completely insolent.",angry
Turn it off. It is driving me mad.,angry
"Well, do try to control yourself darling.",angry
Turn it off.,angry
You really do need to develop uh a clearer head.,angry
Turn it off.,angry
I- I hate you.,angry
Amanda-- Listen- Listen-,angry
I hate you.,angry
"No, no. I'm tired of listening to you. You're boorish and idiotic and completely overbearing.",angry
Very music- amusing indeed.,angry
"Yeah, very amusing. Let me go. I'm getting out of here. I can't believe I intended to marry you.",angry
"You are a vile tempered, loose living, wicked little beast, and I never want to set eyes on you again.",angry
"Oh, marry you again? I must have been insane. What was I thinking? I mean, you're completely outrageous.",angry
"Shut up, shut up. I wouldn't marry you again if you came crawling to me on bended knee. You're a mean, evil-minded little vampire and I hope to God I never set eyes on you again.",angry
Beast; brute; cad; whore,angry
Can I help you?,neutral
"Oh, this- this form that you have is the wrong form. You need to go over to the other line on the other side of the D.M.V..",neutral
"Right, but this is the wrong form. Somebody gave you the wrong form.",neutral
"Yeah. So, I can't -- I can't do anything-",neutral
"No, but this is for um- replacements and you need a new -- whole new license as a California --",neutral
"I'm not getting a -- well, you wait in this line and not get an attitude.",angry
"No, I understand and there are a lot of people here. But what I'm telling you is that it's different for different states and since your getting a new license in the state of California -- You have to fill out a different form than you did.",neutral
I know.,neutral
Yeah. I know it's gonna take a minute. But you-- so you might as well get started now.,neutral
"Wouldn't you? Oh, come on. you just tell me. You would make an exception for me.",angry
I'm gonna- I'm gonna bring security over and have them escort you out.,angry
"Well, that's unfortunate, sir. You're gonna have to go stand in the other line now.",angry
"Sweetheart, I've got to tell you something. I just got a call. I'm going to Iraq.",sad
What?,surprise
"I know it's really crappy timing, but I don't have a choice.",sad
"What? No, you can't!",fear
You didn't- Did you tell them you have two young children at home?,fear

But so many people have died.,fear
"I know. I know. I know. But, you know what? That doesn't mean it's gonna be me; does it?",sad
No. It doesn't. And you can't think like that.,sad
"I mean, I-I know that you're a good soldier, but not everybody else is. and what if",fear
I don't want you to -- I know. I know. You can't worry about me. You've got to worry about the kids. And you've got to take care of the kids for me. Okay? Take care of the kids for me; all right?,sad

"Well, instead I climb up on the rock and like I- I didn't do it -- well, I did it on purpose. I made it look like I accidentally did it. I slipped down into this pool of water, right? And she freaks out because I slide all the way down this rock. And um-",happy

"Okay Okay, And Um- letters and numbers and stuff. Uh- Can you - Can you just type in IP address search? And hit enter.",neutral
"Uh huh, Okay.",neutral
Okay? Does it list your IP address there?,neutral
"Uh, yeah looks -- no, no. It's set to zeros.",neutral
"It's set to zeros. Okay, maybe that's our problem. That could very well be our problem there. Somehow you've lost your IP address. I'm not sure why that would happen every week. It could be a cycling issue, something like that. But let's go ahead and type your IP address in again.",neutral
"Well, if it does happen again, let me give you my direct number and you can call me. Actually, I'll give you my cell number. Um- It's --",neutral
Wow. That would be amazing. Really?,surprise
"Of course. we seriously- Yeah, I mean, obviously you've worked- you know -- I don't want to hassle you anymore.",neutral
"Oh, my God. I can't even tell you how much of a relief that is. I literally call and talk to five different people. Like last week it went off and I spent an hour and a half on the phone with different people. And I've been doing that like every, every other week for months now.",happy
I completely understand.,neutral
Absolutely. And I just don't want that to happen to you anymore.,neutral
Absolutely. It's a new service we are offering.,neutral
"Yeah, accountability. It's awesome.",happy
Uh huh Uh huh We want you to be happy. You're our customer. You're the most important thing. Okay?,neutral
"Wow. You know I was thinking about changing internet providers, but but that- that really is enough to change my mind.",happy
"Great. Well, that makes me very happy. That makes us all happy here at D.S.L. Extreme. Is there anything else I can help you with?",happy
No. I'm just gonna go have a fantastic day now.,happy
All right. You have a wonderful day. Call us anytime.,neutral
Okay. Thanks.,happy
"All right. Bye, bye.",happy
What's he going to say? Maybe we should tell him before he sees it.,sad
When? I was the first one up. He was still in bed. How could he have seen it?,sad
Did you talk to him?,sad
No. I figured it was best to leave him alone.,sad
He cried hard?,sad
"Why should he dream about him, walking around looking for him at night? Do we contradict him? Do we say straight out that we don't have any hope anymore, that we haven't had any hope for years now?",angry
For Gods sake! Three years! Nobody comes back after three years. That's insane!,angry
"The trouble is the God damn newspapers. I mean every every week a kid turns up, missing like longer than Larry.",angry
You know.,neutral
I'm going to ask her to marry me.,neutral
"Well, what do you want me to do? You're old enough to make- to know your own mind.",angry
"Oh, so it isn't just my business?",angry
You infuriate me sometimes. Do you know that? God.,angry
"Isn't it your business, too, if dad -- if I tell dad and he throws a fit about it? I mean, you have such a talent for ignoring things.",angry
"I ignore what I got to ignore. I mean, the girl is Larry's girl.",angry
She is not Larry's girl!,angry
"From your father's point of view he's not dead and she's still his girl. Now, you can go on from there if you know where to go, Chris, but I don't know. So what can I do for you?",angry
"Well, you're a considerate fella, there's nothing wrong in that",neutral
To hell with that!,angry
Have you asked Annie yet?,neutral
"Well, what if she feels like your father? And how do you know she will marry you?",neutral
"Well, the trouble is you never saw enough women.",neutral
So what? I'm not fast with women.,angry
"I've given it three years of thought. I hoped that if I'd waited, dad would have forgotten about it by now. And we could have like a normal wedding and everybody happy.",angry
"But if that can't happen, I'll just have to get out.",angry
What the hell is this?,surprise
"I'll get out. I'll go get married and live someplace else. I don't know, maybe New York.",angry
Are you crazy?,angry
I have been a good son for too long. A good sucker. I'm through with it.,angry
"Yes. On this, I would.",angry
"Well, you help me stay here.",angry
"All right. But don't think like that. Because what the hell did we work for, Chris? I mean, this whole thing, it's all for you.",angry
Just don't think that way. Do you hear me?,angry
What's he going to say? Maybe we ought to tell him before he sees it.,sad
"What do you mean? I was the first one up, he was still in bed.",surprise
He was out here when it broke.,sad
About four this morning. I heard it crack and I looked out the window and he was standing right there when it cracked.,sad
"I don't know. But after he saw it, he ran back into the house and started crying in the kitchen.",sad
No. I figured it was best to leave him alone.,sad
"Yes, yes he is. I don't know the meaning in it. But I know one thing, mom, we made a terrible mistake with Dad.",sad
"Isn't it your business, too, if I tell dad and he throws a fit about it? You have such a talent for ignoring things.",angry
She's not Larry's girl.,angry
what to hell with that!,angry
Have you asked Annie yet?,neutral
"Well, how do you know she'll marry you? Maybe she feels like your father does.",neutral
The trouble is you don't see enough women. You never did.,neutral
"Well, that's a good reason. But it don't mean a thing. I mean, You haven't seen her since you went to war. It's been five years.",neutral
"Now, what's going to happen to your father, do you know? I don't.",sad
"I've given it three years of thought. I had hoped if I waited, dad would've forgotten him by now and we could have a- a regular wedding and everybody happy.",angry
But if that can't happen then I'll just get out.,angry
What the hell is this?,surprise
"I'll get out. I'll go get married someplace else, I- I'll live someplace else, maybe New York.",angry
Are you crazy?,angry
The business? The business doesn't inspire me.,angry
Must you be inspired?,angry
"Yeah, I'd like one hour a day. If I have to grub for money all day long, I'd like to go home to something beautiful. I'd like a family. I'd like some kids.",angry
You don't want to think like that.,angry
"Well, I am thinking like that.",angry
"No, you don't. I'm a pretty tough guy.",angry
Why does that bother you?,neutral
"Well, maybe maybe he just wanted to see her again.",neutral
Nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see.,neutral
Why do you think he's even thinking that?,neutral
He's got that about it.,neutral
"What's going on here, Joe?",angry
You above all have got to believe.,angry
"What's that suppose to mean, me above all? Look at you, you're shaking.",angry
I can't help it.,angry
"What have I got to hide, Kate? What the hell is the matter with you?",angry
You're the only one I know who loves his parents.,neutral
It's all right. It's a good thing. It's lovely here. The air is sweet.,happy
Why?,surprise
"Well, your mother, first of all, pretty much told me to leave.",neutral
Well-,neutral
"I figured they would, your mother at least.",neutral
"Well, from her perspective, I mean, why else would I come here?",neutral
"Oh, Chris I've been ready for a long time.",happy
I almost got married two years ago.,sad
Why didn't you?,surprise
You felt something that far back?,happy
Everyday since.,happy
I kissed you.,surprise
"Like Larry's brother. Do it like you, Chris. What's the matter?",sad
Lets go for a ride. I I- I want to be alone with you.,sad
"No, nothing like that.",sad
Even in your letters there was something ashamed.,sad
"Yeah, I suppose I have been. But it's going for me.",sad
You have to tell me.,sad
I don't I don't know where to start.,neutral
It wouldn't work like this.,sad
It's so mixed up with so many other things.,sad
"Yeah, sure.",neutral
I lost them.,sad
How many?,sad
Just about all.,sad
"It- It takes time to toss something like that off,I mean, because they weren't just men.",sad
I know it's it's just a little thing but that's just the kind of guys I had. They didn't die. They killed themselves for each other.,sad
"I mean that exactly, anymore selfish -- just a little bit more selfish and they would have been here today. And it gave me an idea as I was watching them all go down.",sad
It was and then I went home. And it was incredible. It didn't have any meaning there.,sad
"I felt what you said, ashamed somehow because nobody had changed at all.",sad
And I guess that included you.,sad
Do you still feel like that?,sad
"I want you now, Annie.",sad
"Because you can't feel like that anymore, Chris. Because everything you have, you have a right to, me included.",sad
[LAUGHTER] What will I do with a fortune?,happy
Annie I am going to make you a fortune.,happy
Fine.,sad
What flashlight?,neutral
I'm just not.,sad
About what?,neutral
It's ridiculous.,neutral
"uh, Carla Can I ask you a question? no, don't get upset, but are you having your period?",neutral
"God damn it, Augie. Seriously, you always ask me that. Why do you ask me that? I hate it. It's so insulting.",angry
"Twice is every time we've tried, that's ever",angry
"No, we won't. It's like waiting up for Santa Clause or something. I feel like as though my whole life is going to be standing on the beach waiting with my eyes opened expectantly, my hands clasped neatly in front of me, waiting for fish to show up. And the fish will not show up.",angry
I did want to see it. I always want to see it. I just- I keep thinking this will be the time and it never is.,sad
Do you remember the first time that we came to see the grunion? It was about four years ago right after we got married. We thought I was pregnant. We had a bottle of champagne and no glasses. You asked me to dance. We took off our shoes. And while we were dancing you said the most intimate things to me right in my ear so I could feel them as much as hear them.,sad
"And I remember thinking to myself, finally. I am as happy as I am supposed to be.",sad
"Dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne out of the bottle.",sad
"It was in the car, right? When we were passing Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said, Let's stop and get champagne. and I said that times a wasting or something like that, right? You wanted it to be like it was before, right?",neutral
I would rather not remember some things. I'd rather not hope for something.,sad
No.,sad
No.,sad
No.,sad
No.,sad
I just want- I just want things to turn out the way they are supposed to.,sad
"Well, welcome to the human race. Do you think this is what I had planned? Do you think that when I proposed that I had this great fantasy going that four years down the road we would end up arguing on the beach over some fish?",angry
"Do you think that I thought there would be times when you would look at me like I was used Kleenex or I would look at you and think, good God, when's the next flight to Alaska? No. No, I'm just like you. I thought it would all be like peaches and roses, and sand in our toes, and wind in our hair, and the fish would always come. And the bills would magically pay themselves. And we'd have three fat rosy kids. But, ha ha, baby, the jokes on us!",angry
"Because you know what you get, Carla? You know what you get? This.",angry
But this isn't at all what I wanted it to be.,sad
"Now, I know. Me either",sad
"This is just this. I mean, it's a lot and everything. But it's not, you know, something else. Am I making any sense?",sad
I'm trying the best I can.,sad
"I know that, Augie. I do. I know that. And and I know that this meant a lot to you and and it's special, you know, with the sand and the moon but.",sad
But I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else.,sad
"Maybe if you're with somebody else, too?",sad
I didn't say that.,sad
"No, I know. But I know I don't make you happy.",sad
"For heavens sake, Augie, whatever I am doing, I'd rather it be with you.",sad
Really?,surprise
"Yes. Don't you know that? I mean, You're probably the one you wishes you were with somebody else, somebody who didn't take everything so hard and who knew how to enjoy herself.",sad
"Actually, now that you mention it, no. I don't.",happy
"I don't know. I think this is a pretty good spot. I mean, look at the view of the moon from here.",happy
"Yes, I did notice that. It does look really beautiful over the water. Big old white moon.",happy
"Oh, well look what we've got here.",happy
"Well, it isn't champagne.",happy
"No. I'm beginning to think you might be right. I think this might be the spot after all. Augie, I'm sorry.",happy
Or not.,happy
Or not.,happy
Do you think it's them?,fear
Must be them then?,fear
"We're all right, aren't we, darling, whatever happens?",neutral
Don't laugh at me. I'm serious.,neutral
Who's they?,neutral
"If I laugh at everything, then I must laugh at us too.",neutral
"Well, will we always bicker and fight?",neutral
"What if one of us dies, does the other one laugh then?",neutral
"Elliott, worms don't pop.",neutral
You knew there was nothing in that.,neutral
Only a trivial little broach.,neutral
Not at all. I quite like it. I wear it often.,neutral
"Oh, maybe a little. Nothing serious.",neutral
"Well, what of it.",neutral
Well it gave him a lot of pleasure and it didn't hurt me.,neutral
"Well, that's a nice point of view I must say.",angry
"Me, too, bored stiff.",angry
Do you want some brandy?,neutral
No thanks.,neutral
I think I'll have a little.,neutral
It's becoming a habit with you.,neutral
"Amanda, really.",angry
Just making myself fascinating for you.,neutral
"No, it isn't.",angry
"No, it it is not, be quiet.",angry
It's a pity you didn't have a little bit more brandy. It might have made you a little less disagreeable.,angry
They snap.,angry
"So, did you see much of Peter Burden after the divorce?",neutral
"Yes, I did quite a lot.",neutral
"You must have let him kiss you quite a good deal more then, huh?",angry
"I'm sure you had a riotous time, no restrain at all, very enjoyable. You never had much anyway.",angry
I am not the slightest bit drunk.,angry
You always had a weak head.,neutral
I do believe that I have said already that I had three minuet liquor glasses of brandy in the entire evening. A child of two couldn't get drunk of that.,angry
"Oh, really? How about a child of three, or child of six, what about a child of nine?",angry
Not- Would you shut up.,angry
"You know, we could get a really good debate going on about this. You know intemperate tots.",angry
You know what? That's a very good idea. I think I will.,angry
"You better turn that off, I think.",angry
Because it's very late and you'll disturb the people upstairs.,angry
"Well, there are people downstairs, I suppose.",angry
This is no time of the year for Tunis.,angry
I do I shall do no such thing.,angry
Very well. If you have to be boorish and idiotic.,angry
Turn it off. It's driving me mad.,angry
You are far too temperamental. Try to control yourself.,angry
Turn it off!,angry
Go away! Go away! I- I hate you.,angry
Very amusing indeed.,angry
"You know what, I'm sick and tire of listening to you. You're a-- You're a total sadistic bully.",angry
Ja! Very funny.,angry
"Stop. Would you just go away? I mean, you're conceited, and overbearing, and utterly impossible.",angry
"You are a vile tempered, wicked living, evil little beast. And I hope I never set eyes on you ever again.",angry
This is the end! Do you understand me? This is the end.,angry
"Oh, you're not going like this.",angry
"Yes, I am. Let go with me",angry
"[GARBAGE] No, you're not.",angry
"You are a cruel fiend and I-I loath you. I thank God I realized who you are before I decided to marry you again. Oh my God, never!",angry
oh! Marry you again? I wouldn't marry you again if you came crawling to me on bended knee.,angry
Beast,angry
You're a wicked little vampire. And I pray to God I never set eyes on you again as long as I live.,angry
Brute,angry
